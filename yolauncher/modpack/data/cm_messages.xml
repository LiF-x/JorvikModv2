<string id="698">Gottlungs. &#10;Native to the most fertile grasslands in the Central and Western parts of the Wulpic Empire (wulpus means glory or magnificence), the Gottlungs’ live comfortably, with a weaker constitution than their neighboring counterparts. What they lack in strength, however, they make up for in their lean and agile build; their gait and gestures are very graceful and their minds are extremely sharp and flexible. The Gottlungs are also a fair and understanding race, making them very receptive to everything, from the new to the unusual; thus, they don’t shun useful adoptions, making the Gottlungs great craftsmen, diplomats, merchants, and travelers.  &#10;Their land is famous, not only for high crop yields, but for its naturally rich veins of coal and metals. This land is surrounded from three sides by seas, rich in fish and thriving aquatic life, giving yield to a bountiful fishing trade, thus there are a lot of seasoned sailors and anglers among the Gottlungs. &#10;Covetous eyes surround the Gottlungs’ prosperous lands, forcing them to take up arms against the greedy, warmongering neighbors. Despite this, they typically prefer peaceful negotiations rather than the open fight on a battlefield. While at war though, they have no rival in discipline and organization and their craftsmen make superior weapons. Gottlungs are masters of their light, but impressively strong, swords, and they use a firm row of spearmen armed with long pikes to strike and defend the first blow in a battle.</string>
<string id="699">Slavards. &#10;The harsh North is home for the Slavards. Their tribes dwell in unpassable Northern forests, making their settlements on the banks of rivers, lakes or swamps. They also inhabit Northern sea islands and fjords. These are tall, strong, and tough people with light or red hair and eyes the deep colors of a Northern sky. They are exceptional hunters and anglers; tireless sea wanderers and whalers; fearsome sea brigands, explorers and merchants. &#10;Slavards are trueborn warriors, comprising the best part of the Wulpic Emperor’s guard. During battle, the Slavard relies on the devastating power of their battle-axe, which they wield masterfully. &#10;Northmen are strong on foot and do not typically favor cavalry. Southern folk tell the tale of that Slavards are so big and tough that no horse can handle such a burden, and so they mostly travel on boats instead of horses.</string>
<string id="700">Khoors. &#10;Like a swarm of locusts, these Nomadic tribes move along the Great Steppe at the South and East of the Wulpic Empire. From time to time, they invade the Gottlung’s realm, bringing death and devastation and instilling fear in peaceful farmers and craftsmen.&#10;However, when the Great Steppe calms down, the ferocious Khoors turn into average herdsmen, tending their herds throughout their lands. During these times, Khoors visit their neighbors — not as ruthless pillagers, but as tradesmen supplying leather, wool, meat and valuable steeds, in exchange for bread and crafts. &#10;Nomads are inseparable from their horses, starting early in their childhood; other races even consider them as a single being. The Khoors, on foot, are exceptional archers — while on horseback, they are lightning fast, with their pike and a light sabre. Mounted on their high-spirited horses, Khoors attack an enemy and encircle their foe, before bombarding them with continuous attacks from each side. Luring their enemy through their tactic of false retreats, the Khoors can wipe out hordes of enemies by enticing them towards their heavy cavalry, and gathering them under the archer’s volleys.</string>

<string id="1534" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Your jaw is pierced by a jolt of horrendous pain. Those accursed toothworms! Once they start tossing and turning, gnawing on the meet of your tooth, you cannot help howling! You recollect seeing an itinerant healer pull a whole nest of worms out of a blackened tooth. Each of them was as big as an earthworm!</string>
<string id="1535" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You feel a chill run down your spine. Someone must have walked over your grave just now. With great concern you think that you, too, will be buried deep underground. What could you take with you? "Let them see, even in the great beyond, that my heart is neither that of a coward or a miser, and that my life was lived with dignity. What will you put in the bark that takes me on my final voyage? A horse's bone? A hammer? Golden coins?"</string>
<string id="1536" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You are seized by a suffocating cough. As you catch your breath, you are thinking that you should see a good healer at some point. They should be able to chase the demons away. The memory from a few winters ago, one of a healer lighting up a mixture of roots and herbs and making a great deal of smoke as a result, is still fresh in your mind. With your own eyes you saw serpentine spirits with no substance to their form leave your body.</string>
<string id="1537" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">The mead of the gods is suddenly poured over you, and you stand still, awed by the amazing sound: "The gods have poured over their celestial chalice, lighting the amber of the cold earth in the middle."</string>
<string id="1538" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You suddenly stub your little toe. A strong piercing pain makes you pull one one leg and jump around on the other foot, as though you were a giant sparrow. You are enraged — your first impulse is to grab an axe, to chop off the swinish digit, and to throw it to the dogs!</string>
<string id="1539" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You sneeze. You rummage in the folds of your garments for an amulet — may this not be an illness! Away with thee! May every illness and malady be gone from me!</string>
<string id="1540" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Suddenly you trip and twist your foot. You carefully try to step on it and realize you won't get far. You cannot shift your weight onto your left foot — it hurts and is beginning to swell.</string>
<string id="1541" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You feel a sudden sting in a soft and private part of your anatomy. You begin to itch furiously, trying to reach and squash the revolting bloodsucker dining on your body.</string>
<string id="1542" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You feel the air that you swallowed as you ate tear out of its confines and head outwards. That was some burp! Even more thunderous than the gods holding chariot races in their celestial domains!</string>
<string id="1543" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You feel a terrible itch right in the middle of your back — the very spot your fingernails cannot reach. You grunt and writhe like an enormous overfed worm.</string>
<string id="1544" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You yawn with great gusto, opening your mouth wide. Then you realize something and quickly cover your mouth with the palm of your hand: there are all sorts of fiends waiting eagerly to mock a good man by entering his body through his open mouth.</string>
<string id="1545" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Suddenly you feel a pain in your stomach. You clench your jaws. There are beads of sweat on your face. If only you had some crushed chicken stomachs right now… You'd surely feel better in an instant!</string>
<string id="1546" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You are overcome by hiccups. You think that a fly must have flown into your stomach through your mouth and slap yourself on the belly to chase it out.</string>
<string id="1547" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Suddenly you feel a strange emptiness inside — it appears to be in your stomach. Oh, to be back home again… Everyone used to have so much fun. Those feasts were so magnificent! No one would do any work for three days in a row. Everybody ate meat cooked in gigantic pots, drank heady ale, and sprinkled sacrificial blood all over the place. Ah, those halcyon days… Their memory is so dear to one's heart…</string>
<string id="1548" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You suddenly lose balance and start waving your arms around like a wounded duck. Your foot slips perfidiously, and you fall on your back. A dull pain confirms it: Mother Earth has given the back of your head a somewhat different shape after a mighty crash.</string>
<string id="1549" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You snort. You remember those filthy swines making obscene jokes about your mother. You replied slowly, with great emphasis: "How about you flap your backsides instead of your tongues?" and proceeded to send your fist right into the fattest one's mug. He instantly started snorting — he must have choked on the putrid liquid that had served him as blood.</string>
<string id="1550" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You feel a sudden chill. You turn around, but see no one behind you. You remember the tale of the Hobbler, who had his eye tied after his death and even dragged out through a hole in one of the walls, lest he remember the way back… Even though they fixed the hole later, Hobbler kept coming back to that house, doing away with most of those who lived in this area.</string>
<string id="1551" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Some salty sweat trickles down your nose and drops right onto your lips. You instantly recollect the glorious ancient custom of preserving your foes' heads in salt. You remember how your father brought a salted head back from one of his campaigns. Albeit an eye short, it was the most fascinating toy ever!</string>
<string id="1552" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You feel your blood rush to your ears and your sight darkening. You seem to notice a shape of a tall and mighty figure right in front of you. You would never reach its shoulders, even if you put all your kinfolk on top of each other. The nebulous figure slowly melted. What could it be? Was it just blood rushing to your head, or a warning from one of the gods?</string>
<string id="1553" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You feel a chill and shiver. You might want to find some warmer clothes.</string>
<string id="1554" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You scratch your head, and your fingers catch a louse. You look at it and think that each of us is just like a louse in the hands of the gods. You can decide its fate just like they rule over our lives and deaths. This makes you equal to the gods. You squash the revolting creature with your fingernails with great relish.</string>
<string id="1555" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You raise a hand to scratch your nose and notice a knobbly wart sitting right between your fingers. An awkward place — you should get rid of it. You could find a mushroom and tie it to your hand. Or catch a grasshopper — their saliva can remove every fiendish growth from one's skin. You cannot pull the wart out, after all — their roots go all the way down to one's guts.</string>
<string id="1556" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You can hear the words often uttered by an old man you had once known: "All of yon business is most fascinating, but you might consider doing something worthy for once, me good lad."</string>
<string id="1557" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">There it is again! You get the feeling as if somebody was watching you.</string>
<string id="1558" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">For a brief moment, you can clearly feel that you are controlled by some unknown powers — as if you were not a master of your own fate, but a mere marionette in someone's skilled hands.</string>
<string id="1559" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Suddenly you get a vision of someone's face in the air that surrounds you — it has a mean of great concern and seems vaguely familiar. You shake your head and look about yourself in alarm — but no, there is no one there…</string>
<string id="1560" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You stretch your numb and weary shoulders. You feel like dropping everything, but you're not accustomed to quitting halfway, so you get back to work.</string>
<string id="1561" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You feel a sudden burning pain in your hand. You instantly jerk it back and notice bright green leaves of another species among the flat wide leaves of the apple tree. The poisonous parasite has caught you unawares. You know that already before dusk you will start itching like a mangy mutt, and there will be blisters on your skin.</string>
<string id="1562" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You feel an unpleasant tingling in your neck. It is as if you had a hundred ants under your collar biting you. You shouldn't stare upwards for so long — your neck feels stiff and numb. You need a rest.</string>
<string id="1563" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">A nice and crunchy apple falls down on your head. You head is ringing and you remember how you threw a rock at the Moon once, but it ended up falling to the ground and landing on an old dog. It was fun, but you still didn't feel gratified. Why don't rocks stay up in the sky? Things always end up falling down. There must be some sort of magic inside the Earth, after all. Or it might be the work of spirits of some sort.</string>
<string id="1564" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">An apple falls down on your head. The top of your head hurts and you smash your fist into the bark of the tree. The apple tree produces a crackling sound, and the rough bark scrapes your knuckles raw.</string>
<string id="1565" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Suddenly, a sharp branch pricks your hand. What could it be? You see a long gray splinter underneath your skin. You won't be able to get it out at once — you shall have to bear with it for a while and work with more care.</string>
<string id="1566" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You run your hand over the rough bark of the apple tree. The gray and scaly bark looks cracked like dry soil during a drought.</string>
<string id="1567" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You cannot reach the apples that grow on the upper branches. You hit the tree to shake down the fruit. You remember that fallen apples get bruised and broken, so it's best to eat them at once.</string>
<string id="1568" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Old one-eye likes to tell tall tales about beautiful maidens who live in faraway lands and feed travelers with apples granting immortality. Or maybe it's their local god that feeds on nothing but magic apples. He should really pull the other one — we surely have nothing of the sort growing here.</string>
<string id="1569" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You remember how a few years ago the snow stayed on the ground almost until the end of spring and how the frost has destroyed a great many trees. The Heavens were merciful this year, though, and the Goddess of Spring warmed the Earth up in time.</string>
<string id="1570" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">The sun is pleasantly warm on your skin, and it makes the golden apples ripen. As you watch the apples growing a deeper yellow, you remember the tale of a magic chest with golden apples that belonged to the Goddess of Youth. They say that whoever tastes them will be granted eternal youth. It would sure be nice to lay your hands on a chest like that… You get lost in your daydream, losing your balance and falling off the tree as a result.</string>
<string id="1571" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You remember a madman that turned up in your native village one day. He would shout that apples were the fruit of demons and that they should never be eaten. He claimed apples would draw the wrath of the Heavens down onto mankind. A large crowd had gathered around him. There was a great buzz, and then they stuffed his gob full of apples. He had tried to choke them down, but he died in the attempt. He must have spoken the truth — the wrath of Heavens smothered him.</string>
<string id="1572" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You feel an unpleasant prickling in one of your fingers. You take a closer look at your palm, and see that a sharp twig has ripped your skin open. You'll have to wait a while before you can work with this hand.</string>
<string id="1573" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You bury one of the fruit underneath the apple tree. This is your way of thanking the gods for a plentiful harvest and expressing a hope for their future benevolence.</string>
<string id="1574" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You remember your grandfather saying, "Grass is best cut when it's wet with dew, and harvest is best gathered when it's dry." But it is one's hunger that chooses the best time for apples.</string>
<string id="1575" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You notice lots of yellowish fruit underneath the tree — someone must have scattered them by shaking the tree quite recently. Your mouth begins to water when you remember just how sweet and juicy they are — these must be the best apples around! You gather them into your bag, amazed by your luck.</string>
<string id="1576" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You notice a large caterpillar on one of the apple tree leaves. You suddenly think of just how amazing the ways of nature are — this pitiful worm is born ugly, but rewarded with wings in the next life. Is there a happy transformation of the same sort awaiting you? You squash the caterpillar with your fingers in deep contemplation.</string>
<string id="1577" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You feel a burning sensation on your neck. You slap your neck with your hand in annoyance and notice a squashed wasp. The little pest is dead, but it has left you its sting as a souvenir. You cringe as you rub the bite.</string>
<string id="1578" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You notice a long white writhing creature gnawing its way into the hard ripe apple. You squash the worm with your fingers, recollecting the words of your mother: "You cannot fool worms — they always choose the best apples."</string>
<string id="1579" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You see the work of the solar deity on one of the apples — a bleak print of a leaf. You are jubilant — it is a good sign! Your luck will surely change for the better now.</string>
<string id="1580" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">It seems to you as though you see thin golden threads in the ground. You instantly remember the old legend of the God of the Netherworld who keeps his gold-haired daughter deep underground. If only you could manage to drag the girl out by her tresses, you'd end your days a wealthy man. The pickaxe rings as it hits the ground, and a cloud of dust covers your eyes. You rub them irritatedly — serious work has no place for idle daydreaming.</string>
<string id="1581" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">The pickaxe hits the ground. You seem to hear a muffled rumble somewhere in the depths. What could possibly hide there? Could the legends of the craftsmen from underground be true? Worldly-wise people say that underground folk lure skilled craftsmen and miners into their tunnels and hold them captive down there. Those who end up in their domain never see the light of day again.</string>
<string id="1582" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Your lower back feels like it's breaking — you have pains and aches in your entire body. All you want is to lie down onto the ground and never rise again. Most importantly, don't bend your back — keep it as straight as you can. You have to do away with the bad habit of bowing — even to Mother Earth herself!</string>
<string id="1583" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Didn't you just see strange sparkles in the rock? It could be quartz, which means that there may be rare minerals nearby! You were right — a small but precious stone is now yours.</string>
<string id="1584" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You catch your breath, admiring the uncanny chipped spot. Whimsical lines form a delicate vegetative pattern. None of those grow on your land… These must be the pictures of underground forests and gardens.</string>
<string id="1585" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You swing the pickaxe with force, but the hard ground suddenly resists you. The pickaxe gives a jolt and slaps your hands. You hear a cracking sound. There is a jagged crack that meanders its way up through the handle — the wood has proven too weak for your efforts.</string>
<string id="1586" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">The pickaxe feel like an extension of your body, and you resiliently dig your way in, fused together like a magical amphisbaena. The earth moans and clenches its muscles, resisting your invasion. You feel a sharp pain — the fingers of your right hand lose their grip. You might have guessed — a dislocated joint. The Earth wins this battle against you.</string>
<string id="1587" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">The pickaxe enters the soft ground smoothly; like a knife through butter. But, alas, your joy is premature — your instrument gets stuck, as if caught in a vise. You give it a jerk, and another one...Got it! It seems the heavy head will stay underground forever — all you have in your hand is the handle!</string>
<string id="1588" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You give the pickaxe a wide swing and plunge it into the ground — but it hits a rock and swings back! You hear a sharp, metallic clang, and suddenly you're seeing stars right before your eyes! Well, even a bull would have been knocked out from such a blow from a pickaxe handle!</string>
<string id="1589" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You stop to catch your breath and study the excavated soil. It bears an uncanny resemblance to the apple pie your dear mother would bake on Sundays. This part is like a layer of dough, and that one is just like the fragrant apples inside. With a generous portion of thick cream right on top. Perhaps, the dwarf folk that live underground know the art of baking pies, too?</string>
<string id="1590" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">There's an unpleasant stinging sensation in your palm. You examine your left hand and you see blisters that have formed on the rough ridges of your palm. Some of them have burst, with blood smeared all across the grubby skin. You spit with great rancor, then tear a piece of cloth off your sleeve and bandage your palm.</string>
<string id="1591" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You swing your pickax and suddenly feel a resemblance to a none-too-bright bird — one that had never managed to learn to fly and awkwardly flaps its fingers in its pathetic attempts to become airborne. You seem to feel short of breath — you might want to catch a breather.</string>
<string id="1592" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You feel as though you have caught the rhythm of Mother Earth herself. You hit with your pickaxe, and it answers with a muffled thud. The rhythm of this laborious underground music seems to reverberate through your entire body, which also feels like it's ringing. Suddenly, a heavy rock hits you in the jaw. It is beginning to swell. A hard blow to punish your overconfidence.</string>
<string id="1593" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You contemplate the hardships of a miner's labor; it must be hard to dig right in front of you. What if you have to dig further down? An unstable, treacherous slope that threatens to crumble at any moment, while a sack of rocks is nearly breaking your back.</string>
<string id="1594" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You get the notion that it would be nice to build an entire city underground. With squares joined by streets, and also roads for horses and carts. It may be easier to move around when you are underground — no woods or rivers to hinder you. You check yourself irritatedly. Where do these wild fancies come from? Sometimes the visions sent by the gods are outright ridiculous.</string>
<string id="1595" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Your watering eyes suddenly notice a reddish vein deep in the rock. This is how they find gold — right next to the copper! You hit away with your pickaxe, only to realize you were wrong. It was a mere waste of time and effort.</string>
<string id="1596" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">The pickaxe suddenly rebounds from the hard and rocky ground, striking sparks and a host of small pebbles out of the rock you hit. Your hand jerks toward your right eye — a sharp pain lets you know that one of the pebbles hit you right in the eye.</string>
<string id="1597" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Were there any cases of good people digging the ground diligently, only to fall through and end up in the halls of the God of the Netherworld? No such story has ever been told — the Earth must be truly deep.</string>
<string id="1598" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">They say there are mysterious beings living in such hills. Their children are slow to grow, so they sometimes swap them for human babies. You think you knew one of those changelings — he looked just like one of the underground folk.</string>
<string id="1599" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Sometimes you find yourself thinking that it may be cozier underground. It is as if you were closer to Mother Earth's gigantic heart — and sometimes you get the feeling you can hear it beat.</string>
<string id="1600" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Another strike, and then another! No use. You think it's just your luck to have come across the dwelling of the Álfar, the underground folk! Their craftsmen can make gates that will resist a celestial hammer, let alone a mere pickaxe!</string>
<string id="1601" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You feel a smell coming from the soil. It is that special musty odor of roots searching for nutrient juices underground, old rotten leaves, and sweet luscious saplings. The smell of life itself.</string>
<string id="1602" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You straighten your back and knead a ball of earth in your hands. It is cold and moist. It crumbles in your hands with a sweet aroma of tree roots.</string>
<string id="1603" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You straighten your back, feeling a dull pain in its lower part. Your hands are still clenching the handle of your spade, but you freeze, amazed by the thought that Mother Earth doesn't only feed you — she also takes things away. She provides you with food and shelter, but someday she will take away it all, including yourself. A mean and malicious deity…</string>
<string id="1604" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Your spade slices an earthworm in two. You recollect the time when you saw your half-witted neighbors drop those creatures on the ground in hopes they would till it with their bodies. The kids from all around the place brought those crackpots a bunch of snakes from the forest. Snakes are much better for tilling, after all. You rub the scar behind your ear, which reminds you of your neighbors' ingratitude.</string>
<string id="1605" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You pummel away at the soil. With each strike the spade tears into the insides of the earth — its wounds glisten with moisture and vapors as if they were bleeding. You pretend to be a mighty warrior who knows no defeat. Even though you may have a spade instead of a shiny sword. May the stronger opponent win.</string>
<string id="1606" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Your spade stops halfway, as if the soil had gotten denser. You scatter the soil with your foot. Indeed, your instrument may as well have been caught in the tentacles of an octopolus. These tough tree roots won't let you go deeper into the flesh of the Earth. It takes you a lot of effort to unearth those pesky roots.</string>
<string id="1607" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You feel the spade give a jerk in your hands. There is a short clang and a sudden cracking sound. You pull the spade out of the soil and see that your worst suspicious were true — the spade smashed into a rock, and the handle got broken at the very head.</string>
<string id="1608" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">A sudden pain above the knee gives you a jolt and makes you throw down your spade. You turn around quickly and see your foe — the narrow dusty body of a snake crawling away. Your are furious and throw a stone into the escaping reptile. But you a more important problem than revenge — you are beginning to feel the effects of the venom.</string>
<string id="1609" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You shovel the soil away and notice the long red bodies of earthworms. You think that these pitiful creatures also have their uses, even though they are deaf and blind to everything. Skilled healers use them for treating eye diseases, burns, insomnia, and headaches.</string>
<string id="1610" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You imagine there is treasure somewhere near. Your hard and monotonous labor is suddenly painted in the golden hues of found treasure. The pebbles that hit the metal feel like coins. Just in case, you banish the spirits guarding the treasure: "Begone, it was not you who had put it there, so it is not for you to take!"</string>
<string id="1611" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You straighten your back to wipe the sweat off your brow and see a raven take off. Its loud cawing can be heard for miles around. You are wondering whether it could be one of the ancient god's spies bearing tidings.</string>
<string id="1612" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You feel an ache in your lower back. You try to straighten, but you barely manage it. You feel as if someone had stuck a hundred daggers into your back. You remember how your mother would make some sour dough and then wrap it around father like a belt. But you need peace and quiet. You rest on the spade and try to catch your breath.</string>
<string id="1613" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You see a narrow gray wire crawl past you. A snake! You stay motionless and wait for the dangerous reptile to crawl away. You wipe what feels like a gallon of cold sweat from your brow and kiss the little white pebble — the enchanted charm that wards against snakes has proven its utility yet again.</string>
<string id="1614" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">The spade gives a sudden jerk in your hand and goes sideways. You feel a sharp pain in your right eye, which instantly fills with tears. A solid piece of rocky earth that you hadn't noticed broke when you hit it with your spade, and one of the shards hurts your eye.</string>
<string id="1615" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Your spade makes a clinking sound as it hits something. You bend down and unearth a flat disk out of a dull yellow metal with elaborate carvings. Looks like a brooch. Who could have lost it here?</string>
<string id="1616" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You recollect the tales of your forefathers about their battles for the land. They used to chase away peasants and everybody else. The most hated enemies would have their backs hacked open and their lungs extracted through the freshly-cut openings… Fierce times by any account!</string>
<string id="1617" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think of how nice it would be to find some buried treasure. But whoever has heard anything of buried treasure being found in our days? People are no fools — everybody tries to hide their valuables as deep and as far away as they can. For a militant god has ordered it for every warrior slain in battle to enter his hall bearing all of their wealth. No matter whether they are buried or cremated of a funeral pyre.</string>
<string id="1618" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You drive the entire head of the spade into the soil, and pull out a huge chunk of earth. You recollect stories of how the whole surface of the land can get covered with such cracks, thousands of feet deep. Mother Earth opens her maw and swallows people, animals, and houses all at once.</string>
<string id="1619" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that digging by itself isn't that hard. Had there be trees here, you would have to do three to four times as much work! After all, there would be trees to burn and chop down, as well as roots to unearth. A great way to break your back, to be sure!</string>
<string id="1620" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">A sharp gust of wind catches you unawares — it playfully raises a cloud of dust and tosses some sand into your face. You have a mouthful of grit, your eyes itch and slam shut. You wipe off the tears with the back of your hand.</string>
<string id="1621" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">The heavy and heady odor of animal habitation rushes up your nostrils like an attacking army. You inhale the air, sniffing loudly — you like the feeling of warmth and security that this smell associates with.</string>
<string id="1622" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You rub your eyes — they are still unaccustomed to the half-light inside. The light that manages to get in through the open door is manifestly insufficient.</string>
<string id="1623" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You take a wide step to avoid a pile of manure and trip over a floorboard. You barely manage to keep your balance and imagine smashing the pesky piece of wood to smithereens as you rub your hurt leg.</string>
<string id="1624" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You smash right into a beam on the ceiling of the shed, and an incandescent flame flares up inside your head. You rub the hurt place forcefully, methodically taking in vain the names of all gods from the very creation in succession, as well as those of their mothers, offspring, and close kin.</string>
<string id="1625" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You decide to catch a breather and put your instrument aside. You look at yourself, thinking you're a right pig. Getting those clothes clean again will be no mean feat. There's also dust and pieces of straw stuck to the manure…</string>
<string id="1626" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You enjoy work in the shed. Some turn their noses up at such jobs as these since they consider them messy. However, you perceive it as a manifestation of the very cycle of life — nothing ever disappears without a trace. Grass and corn transform into manure, which provides nutrition to the next year's grass. An amazing wheel that keeps on turning.</string>
<string id="1627" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Fresh manure — particularly when it's still warm and not quite dry — can be used in a variety of entertaining ways! For example, you can put it in a bucket and hang it over a neighbor's door. The simpleton will step out and get a warm and fragrant shower. I swear he'll just stand there blinking his eyes. Although that might lead to a real row between neighbors. Or maybe not.</string>
<string id="1628" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look at manure and think of all the people who just throw it away. But manure has lots of uses — it's not just a fertilizer. When it's dry and hard, it can heal all the aches in your joints.</string>
<string id="1629" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Your nose catches a delicate and barely felt odor of smoke. It's always pleasant and reliable — it means there is a human dwelling nearby, where you can find food and a place to warm up.</string>
<string id="1630" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">The warm and dense air of the shed has wrapped you in a solid cocoon. It is so saturated with odors that it feels as though you could cut it with a knife.</string>
<string id="1631" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You come to your senses too late when you notice a gray ball in one of the corners. The ball unfurls in an instant and attacks you. You fail to avoid the sudden attack and receive a sharp bite. There is a poisoned swelling growing right under your knee.</string>
<string id="1632" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You step on the warm manure that was hay and grain as recently as an hour ago and slip forward like a young maiden on ice. Falling on ice is just as painful, but nowhere near as horribly messy. You get up groaning, wiping grimy hands on your clothes.</string>
<string id="1633" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You get to business eagerly and productively, completely unprepared for a horrible affront. Your spade slips, and the moist slippery mass hits you right in the face with considerable force. It's a good job no one has seen it!</string>
<string id="1634" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Your eyes adapt to the half-light, and you notice something out of the ordinary. You bend and pick up a shining iridescent feather. You are wondering whether it might be a good omen from the gods, in which case you should keep the feather as a talisman. But what if it's an evil sorcery and has to be burned and scattered to the four winds?</string>
<string id="1635" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look up and see a gray ball in one of the corners, right underneath the ceiling. You poke it with your spade, only to recognize it as a wasp nest the next instant. Too late — the angry buzzing swarm has already come out in search of the trespasser. You cover your face and run! However, you are already beginning to feel the wasps' burning attacks — the bites instantly swell up in ugly itchy blotches.</string>
<string id="1636" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look up and see a gray ball in one of the corners, right underneath the ceiling. You are about to poke it with your spade when you realize it to be a bird's nest. The swallows must have built themselves a home. You decide to let them live — swallows bring good luck.</string>
<string id="1637" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You stop for a moment and listen to the ceaseless bustle of animal habitation. The wood creaks under gusts of wind and footsteps. The birds converse sleepily. Something rustles, someone breathes, and the delicate aroma of hay permeates everything…</string>
<string id="1638" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look about you and think it would be nice to get some twigs for the animals — fresh leaves and bark are always good for them.</string>
<string id="1639" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You hear a rustle behind you. There is no one there. Or so it seems. But is it noon, when you can see a household spirit? What if the spirit is angry and demands order and cleanliness? It might be a good idea to placate it with some porridge with lots of butter.</string>
<string id="1640" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You notice that the southern beams gather more moisture on them. You sigh — at this rate, mildew and rot are not far behind. You probably need to coat the wood with tar.</string>
<string id="1641" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You run your hand over the log. Just as you had thought — the wood bugs have gnawed a bunch of streets and lanes inside it. The wood will eventually rot completely, and the other logs will suffer the same fate! It's like a plague! Would rubbing linen oil all over it do the trick?</string>
<string id="1642" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">What you need to know in this business is where to stick your knife. If it's a bird, you don't have to think much. Chop off the head, and that's it. Larger animals can be tricky. First you need to stun them and then feel for the exact position of the heart. That's where the knife goes. The most important thing is to keep it sharp.</string>
<string id="1643" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">A sacrifice to the gods would be in order. The boss isn't a great fan of domestic animals — he should be given a wolf or a dog, of course. The rest can get a burnt offering of a heart and a liver when the hour is right.</string>
<string id="1644" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You are satisfied with your knife. What matters most in your business is to have a pair of skillful hands and a sharp blade. Neither of them have let you down. With a knife like this, cutting meat will be child's play — it could cut wood like butter!</string>
<string id="1645" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You inopportunely recollect how one of the villagers tried to chop off a rooster's neck without due care — that rooster wandered about the yard for a few days after that. Of course, it could neither eat, nor mate with hens. Crowing was also out of the question, since there was nothing left to crow with. The rooster attracted crowds of gawkers. When it finally died, they burned the carcass. No one felt like eating it.</string>
<string id="1646" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You cautiously enter the half-lit building. After all, you remember how one of those accursed ferrets stole all your chickens once, leaving nothing but feathers behind. They say that these days they see wolves right near human dwellings. And those are after larger prey. You think it would be best to slay all your livestock instead — bursting seems more appealing than giving the wolf so much as a single chunk of meat.</string>
<string id="1647" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You admire your animals contentedly — they surely look good. The gods must be well pleased. You remember how the neighbors' cow gave birth to a two-headed calf once. It may be curious, but it's a very ill omen.</string>
<string id="1648" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You remember the horrendous pestilence from a few years back, when few owners had any livestock left. They still talk about it, claiming the pestilence was brought by the wind. But you know for sure that a witch was to blame. You know this stuff better than most.</string>
<string id="1649" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You take a look at the roof beams — there is a skillfully-woven wreath of twigs bearing mystical symbols hanging right above the entrance. People say that such talismans are failsafe — if you have one of those, no pest or plague can ever hurt your livestock and poultry.</string>
<string id="1650" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look at your livestock and poultry thinking you've seen better-looking specimens. The chickens could be better-fed, and the cows could be plumper. You wonder where you could find a special spell to aid the situation.</string>
<string id="1651" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Chicken soup is pretty good, of course, and the same goes for pork soup. But the best kind of pottage is made from fat saltwater fish. Those slices of pink flesh, that broth with golden drops of oil — if that isn't food of the gods, I don't know what is!</string>
<string id="1652" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think it would be nice to roast a whole carcass someday. Just put it on a spit and place it over the fire. Such feasts could last for days on end, and no guests would leave. Of course, you cannot have a feast without ale — that's the best thing to wash down the meat.</string>
<string id="1653" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You clean the knife with a handful of straw and look at the skinned carcass, recalling your dear mother's cooking with a fair bit of nostalgia. No one could cook pork like she did! She would add sour cream and dump in some herbs. The smell would make everyone's mouth water — even people from the neighboring village!</string>
<string id="1654" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You sharply swing your killing implement, but what could be the matter with you today? The blade has chosen the wrong victim and sliced off one of your fingers! You throw the failed sacrificial victim away and grab the stub with your other hand. You'll have to sear the wound with hot iron.</string>
<string id="1655" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You recall communal feasts where whole mounds of meat would be served. Boiled meat, roast mean, and all kinds of fish. Everyone would bring whatever they had in their pantries. And, of course, rivers — nay, whole oceans — of beer. A feast without beer is like a man without a beard.</string>
<string id="1656" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You flinch as you bandage yourself with a piece of torn cloth, grimacing as you observe beads of blood forming where you pressed your blade to your finger. You definitely sharpened the blade well!</string>
<string id="1657" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You pick up the offal and feel something solid inside. You slice the slippery knot with your knife, and something shiny falls onto your palm. You rub it clean and take a closer look…</string>
<string id="1658" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">The animal's body no longer convulses in your hands  —  it has gone quiet and limp. You see the ground absorb the black steaming blood. You feel as if you are watching life itself leave the body.</string>
<string id="1659" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You are weary and exhausted. The accursed animal refuses to let you catch it, making you run around like mad. You feel as though you ran through all nine worlds. You stop to catch a breath. You are red with fury — you feel like strangling the pesky creature with your own two hands.</string>
<string id="1660" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Amazing  —  the animal has no idea of the fate that's about to befall it. But do any of us know that about ourselves? Neither you, nor me. No one can see into their own future…</string>
<string id="1661" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Satisfied, you feel the weight of the fruits of your labor in your hands. You think it would be great to trade some of it for household utensils if an itinerant trader happened to pass by.</string>
<string id="1662" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">While your eyes adjust to the warm half-light, you recollect the tale about someone's hen laying golden eggs. Wouldn't it be nice to rummage in the hay with your hand and find a few smooth and heavy eggs made of pure gold…</string>
<string id="1663" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You are satisfied with your "haul." As you leave, your foot trips over a floorboard that pops up all of a sudden, and you come crashing down  —  just like an oak struck by one of the Red-Bearded God's lightning bolts. Your hands are empty again, as if you had only just entered.</string>
<string id="1664" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You make sure the "haul" sits tight under your arm lest you drop it, thinking it would be nice to churn the milk into butter, adding enough salt for long-term storage.</string>
<string id="1665" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You wipe your hands with some hay and think it would be really great to drink some buttermilk right about now. Milk is very good for you, of course, but no one drinks it raw, after all! You either need to bring it to a boil, or use it to make some buttermilk.</string>
<string id="1666" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">What you like most is going to the shed on your own. The elders were right  —  another one's eye is always an ill omen. If someone sets out to accompany you when you milk a cow, shear a sheep, or even pick eggs out of the hay, everything will end up going to waste.</string>
<string id="1667" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You straighten your tired back, but it's a pleasant sort of tiredness. You rub your lower back and inhale the warm and spicy aroma of old hay, wet wool, and fermented manure.</string>
<string id="1668" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Having finished your task, you look about yourself. Before you leave, you think that you should bring some twigs tomorrow  —  they will freshen the odor with some woody notes, and it's always good for the animals to chew on some greens.</string>
<string id="1669" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You are about to leave. However, since all you think of is how not to drop what you are carrying, you fail to duck in time. The low-hanging lintel seems to strike a whole bunch of sparks out of your forehead. They could probably burn down the entire shed! You feel your forehead gingerly  —  a huge lump is beginning to grow there.</string>
<string id="1670" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">As you finish your work, you decide to sacrifice some of it to the gods  —  they will surely appreciate it. Then they will be benevolent to you once more.</string>
<string id="1671" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You leave the shed, carrying the fruits of your labor in your hands with great care. You keep thinking of what needs to be done first. Maybe you should make some yogurt out of the milk. Or, perhaps, start processing the wool  —  it needs to be carded and degreased.</string>
<string id="1672" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You exit the shed, bent not so much by your heavy load, but rather the weight of everything that troubles you  —  you remember that the old weight for the spinning-wheel has rolled away, and that now you need to shape another rock into a disk.</string>
<string id="1673" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You carefully step over the floorboard that sticks up, mindful of your load, and think that some madder would come in handy. You could use it to dye the newly-sheared wool bright red  —  the most festive color of them all.</string>
<string id="1674" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You brush away the dust and hay and are about to leave. You think it would be a good idea to stock up on wool. You recall what your dear mother has taught you  —  to dye wool red, you use a special herb. To dye it brown, you need some lichens, and if you want to dye it black, get some of that swamp mud that smells like iron.</string>
<string id="1675" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You carry your load to the exit, contemplating just how amazing the world is.  A mere sheep gives you wool, which is then spun by the women into modest twill fabric, which is sometimes worth its weight in silver. And the stupid hens, which are hardly even considered proper birds, can lay eggs. And if you're hungry, an egg is like a plateful of silver and gold!</string>
<string id="1676" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You stare into the depths of the water tensely. Is that the dark body of a fish moving close to the surface? Or a god's eye traded for a gulp of water from the Lake of Wisdom?</string>
<string id="1677" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">At last you got something with your fishing rod! You pull. The rod bends, but doesn't break. Another effort, and a dark object flies out of the water, as if catapulted. You grab it hastily… but what you find in your hands is but a wet piece of cloth with a pattern still recognizable on it. Someone must have drowned their banner here.</string>
<string id="1678" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You seem to have caught something truly heavy. You cannot pull your catch out of the water  —  it feels as though it's a whale at the very least. And this whale seems to be very reluctant to leave its native element. You wade in the water, bend over and try to disentangle your hook from a snag  —  slimy, but still sturdy enough.</string>
<string id="1679" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You deftly catch the fish and grab it by the tail. You stare at the strange creature, wondering what it might possibly be. It has spikes above its eyes, its fins are splayed out, and its eyes are as yellow as a snake's. You spit in disgust, and also trying to protect yourself from evil spirits, and throw the revolting creature as far into the water as you can.</string>
<string id="1680" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You wait for something to bite and recollect how a few springs ago a gigantic fish was caught in a river during a flood  —  a real monster it was! They say it was a hundred feet long, and its head was used to make a cart. The whole village was eating fish soup until the very Autumn Sacrifice feast.</string>
<string id="1681" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">They say some lakes have no fish in them at all. One day a monster turns up and ends up devouring every living thing in the water. Then it sticks out its long neck and looks far away. Probably looking for another lake. Or, maybe, looking for something to eat on the shore.</string>
<string id="1682" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You hear a soft splash. You hope fervently it isn't water spirits! Those girls have sweet faces, but they are way too mischievous. They can tickle you blue, and then drown you in deep water. Then you'll have to shepherd the underwater herds…</string>
<string id="1683" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">The fishing rod gives a light jerk, and you pull it out with ease. What you see on the hook is a mangy little fish that even a cat wouldn't find appetizing. You don't want it, either. You take it off the hook and throw it in the water.</string>
<string id="1684" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">The cool water with ripples on its surface beckons you to wash away the fatigue. You put your feet in with delight. The water embraces your feet and rocks them gently.</string>
<string id="1685" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">When you're near the water, you feel calm and quiet joy the most vividly. Soft babbling, rhythmic splashes, and sparkling ripples on the surface seem to connect you to the celestial city with long invisible threads.</string>
<string id="1686" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You enter the water knee-deep to cast your line farther. A few moments later you see narrow black pods stuck to your bare ankles. You come ashore and tear the leeches off your feet. Thin crimson trickles mix with the water that runs down your ankles, becoming more transparent. It may even have been good for you to let out some bad blood.</string>
<string id="1687" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You wade in the water in order to free your hook from the snag. Suddenly you feel a sharp pain — as if a dog with a hundred heads had grabbed your foot with its jaws. You get your foot out of the water and try to wrest the beetle away from your wet skin. This hell's spawn is a true curse for anyone who likes to swim.</string>
<string id="1688" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You take a wide swing to sink your line, but loose your footage and fall flat on your face. You hit your stomach, which rings like an empty barrel hit with a fist. You feel a tight knot in your stomach that doesn't let you take a breath. You bend in half and forget about fishing for a while.</string>
<string id="1689" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You swing your fishing rod, and the hook sinks right into your clothes. You try to untangle it, but you only have eyes in front of you. You cannot see what's happening behind your back, and your fingers lack the dexterity needed to catch the metallic tooth. You say a few strong words about the fishing rod, the hook, and the fisherman who has managed to catch himself.</string>
<string id="1690" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You see concentric ripples on the water. You stare into them until your eyes begin to hurt. It might be a large fish playing. Or could it be a water spirit with several heads? You swear you won't touch any of his gold coins even if they torture you! If you do, you shall become a slave in the underwater world forever.</string>
<string id="1691" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You nimbly pull out the line, but your catch doesn't please you — it's but a clump of ill-smelling water vegetation. You irritatedly rip the wet aquatic plants off the hook when you feel a sharp sting — as if you were stung by a wasp. Soon you see a large crimson drop roll down the pricked finger.</string>
<string id="1692" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You cast the line and think that freshwater fish are nice, of course. But seawater fish are both fatter and sweeter. Just to imagine a sea fish sizzling on the coals, dripping with clear juices… Freshwater fish can have the stale smell of still water and slimy duckweed.</string>
<string id="1693" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You gently pull a large and heavy fish out of the water, taking care not to let it slip away. Finally it's on the shore, slapping the ground wetly. You grab it with your hands, but the slimy scales slip right out of your fingers. Then you leap to cover the fish with your belly, but it is full of vigor, as if it were under some spell. One last hurl, and it returns into the water. You remain sitting on the shore, breathing hoarsely and heavily.</string>
<string id="1694" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You keep your eyes on the still surface of the water, without stirring once — as though you were a stone effigy. Not a single rustle. Not a single movement. All of a sudden, two magpies chasing each other filled the air with their deafening chatter. It is as if the air itself became filled with reverberations. That's it, then — it will be a while before a fish bites your bait.</string>
<string id="1695" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that walls are good protection from foes, no doubt. But you gladly recall the words of a great leader whose battlefield feats remain unsurpassed to this day: "The sturdiest wall is a wall of warriors. Nothing offers better defense than valor and bravery."</string>
<string id="1696" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You remember hearing of a wondrous dwelling built around an enormous tree. The tree towered far above the roof, and was covered in amazing blossoms. The dwelling resembled all nine worlds, with the tree at its axis. And the nine worlds, in turn, resembled this miraculous dwelling.</string>
<string id="1697" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You know one thing for certain — before you enter your new home, you must let a cat, a rooster, or a dog get in before you. A hen will work, too. After all, it is common knowledge that whoever enters a new dwelling first will also be the first to die.</string>
<string id="1698" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look at the house and recollect the old tradition of hanging deer antlers on the wall. This has been done since times immemorial. They keep evil spirits at bay.</string>
<string id="1699" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You wonder whose blood was used to build this house. You can, of course, skip the sacrifice, but just how long will such a house stand? The foundation stone must by all means be bathed in the hot blood of a living being.</string>
<string id="1700" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think there must be something special about the walls of your home — they suffice for support in any endeavor. When you are home, you are at your strongest, and no wonders of faraway lands can match the magic power conferred to you by the walls of your own home.</string>
<string id="1701" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think about the warmth of a hearth. Campfires and the blazing furnaces of lavish palaces can warm the body, but only the hearth of your home can warm the soul.</string>
<string id="1702" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">What else do you need if you have a house of your own? A bright fire in the fireplace and a bowl of porridge for the household spirits. If you placate them properly, rest assured that your dwelling will prosper!</string>
<string id="1703" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that a home is always much more than just the walls. It is the real heart of a family — a warm living thing. It ties all the roads and paths walked by father and son, grandfather and grandson, into a single knot. This is whence all your roads begin. This is also where they end, gods willing.</string>
<string id="1704" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that the first thing you will do when you enter the house is draw a wheel on every wall. It is the eternal symbol of life and the sun, and it grants your dwelling good fortune and prosperity.</string>
<string id="1705" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You remember the story of how one cunning villager built himself a house. He didn't want to dig in order for the nearby brook to come closer to his house. He built his dwelling right over that brook, no less. He used stones to fashion a drain and made a cover to go on top, and there was a brook running right through his hall!</string>
<string id="1706" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think of just how often one's fate makes one search for a new home far away from your homeland. When a boy sees his twelfth winter and becomes a man, he has to set forth in search of fame and fortune. Then he has to build a home of his own. And how many of them built a home next to that of their father?</string>
<string id="1707" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You remember your father, who claimed that even porridge was thicker at home. He was absolutely right!</string>
<string id="1708" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You remember how your dear mother would always get angry when one of the brothers would start dreaming of foreign lands. "It is a silly bird that resents its own nest," she'd say.</string>
<string id="1709" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You realize that you love your home just because it is yours — not because of its great size or wealth.</string>
<string id="1710" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think it wouldn't hurt to express your gratitude for shelter to the household deities and to ask them for their patronage.</string>
<string id="1711" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You suddenly realize you are weary of roaming the land. Now that you have walls of your own to shelter you, a mere straw mattress will seem softer than a bed of feathers. And an unleavened bread that is your own tastes better than other people's pies.</string>
<string id="1712" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You recall the words of your grandfather, who would say, "The walls at home are your friends and helping hands." Indeed — they will protect you well against evil spirits and people alike.</string>
<string id="1713" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think how peculiar it is that each house has a smell of its own. It is born of the aroma of food that is cooked here and the breathing of its inhabitants, spiced up by the smoke of the hearth and warmed by the cozy smell of stones and logs that the house was constructed of.</string>
<string id="1714" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You notice a hollow in the tree trunk. It appears to be the resting place of an owl that sleeps the day away. You feel a chill run down your spine — an encounter with this unclean bird bodes ill.</string>
<string id="1715" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look at the tree and at its knotty branches, and note that they resemble the crooked fingers of an old man, always eager to slap your face — or even poke out an eye.</string>
<string id="1716" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look at the rough bark of the tree and notice cracks in it, which resemble narrow paths. You trace one such path with your finger — like a dry riverbed, it joins another, and together they run upwards, towards the canopy.</string>
<string id="1717" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look up and marvel at how large the canopy is. Leaves of this size would keep you dry even in the most furious of thunderstorms. Then you chuckle at your idea: imagine carrying such leaves around with you just in case it rains — like portable covers of sorts.</string>
<string id="1718" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You prod at a piece of loose bark with your fingernail — you can sometimes find fat white maggots underneath. They're ugly things, but they can save a starving person from death.</string>
<string id="1719" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You push aside a branch that's right in your face, and you instantly notice an angry striped creature approach with an annoying buzz. You try to wave it aside, but the wasp is more agile than you. It drives its poisoned dagger smack into your right eyelid.</string>
<string id="1720" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You hear a suspicious rustle in the leaves and jump aside, just in case. No, you must have imagined it. Everything appears to be in order. Those little red ticks wait ever so eagerly for the moment they can rain upon you from the leaves. They can get underneath your skin before you finish stripping frantically.</string>
<string id="1721" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You see something that resembles a gray knot amidst the branches. You pull the branch closer and see it is a construction woven haphazardly out of twigs, with three small dapple eggs in the middle. Well, they'll do you for a snack.</string>
<string id="1722" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You push the branch away and feel as though someone had scattered tiny beads underneath the fabric of your clothes. You rub your body in surprise, only to find your skin begin to itch and burn horribly! Little black ants only look harmless. But they bite like horseflies.</string>
<string id="1723" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You push aside the branches that hang too close to your face, and rip the skin on your finger open on a sharp twig. You attempt to quench the flame of pain and inadvertently pop your finger into your mouth. You furiously tear off the offending twig with the fingers of your other hand.</string>
<string id="1724" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You place your palm on the rough bark, thinking that this tree's whole history can be found underneath the bark. Lean years and fat ones, dry and rainy summers — they are all here, drawn in uneven magical circles around the pith of the tree. But a tree can only tell its story when it dies.</string>
<string id="1725" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You pull a branch before you, but it's so thin and brittle it cracks. The light open wound emits a harsh and somewhat bitter odor. It reminds you the days in your parental home, when springtime filled the air with thousands of new smells, calling everyone to drink in the heady air. It also commanded everyone to take care of a myriad urgent things — on the land, in the woods…</string>
<string id="1726" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You take a close look at the tree, and, reassured, use your fingernails to pry something loose from the bark. You rub a small disk clean and recognize it to be a small silver brooch — the kind used by women to fasten their clothes on their chest. Someone must have stuck one to a tree for fun. Or could it be to mark the tree where they hid a cache of treasure?</string>
<string id="1727" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png"></string>
<string id="1728" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look at the tree and recall the first lessons you received from your father. He said that a soil that is loose and paltry will make a tree grow feeble. A soil that is too moist makes trees grow scraggly, for the water chases all the air away from the roots, and they have nothing to breath with. But rich and loamy soil will make a tree grow tall and shapely.</string>
<string id="1729" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that mighty trees are like mighty warriors. They spread their branches majestically, looking the sun right into the eye without a shade of fear. Thin and feeble trees are cowards hiding behind mighty trunks or lurking well away from the center of the battlefield.</string>
<string id="1730" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You push the branches apart, but one of them refuses to obey, slips out and slaps you right in the face. You feel an unbearable burning pain in your eyes, and tears run down your cheek, large as beans. You decide to take a short break.</string>
<string id="1731" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You raise your head up and try to find the place where the tree meets the firmament. You imagine the tree of life, passing through the heavens of all the universes in a similar manner, with world upon world stacked on it.</string>
<string id="1732" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You pull one of the branches down, but it breaks all of a sudden, and its other end hits you right in the face. You didn't expect such impudence, and now you feel your cheek swelling up painfully. You know that the still dark blood will mark the place where you were hit for a long time, and remind of its existence with dull pain.</string>
<string id="1733" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look at the tree and imagine it to be an old troll, who tries to deceive you and lure you near. You get lost in your daydream, and for a moment it seems to you as though the troll was really trying to reach its mossy and knobbly arm — or branch — toward you.</string>
<string id="1734" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You whisper and mumble old nursery rhymes in a matter-of-fact manner. It seems as though an adult shouldn't believe in children's tales. On the other hand, they always come in handy. What if you really manage to placate the little spirits of the forest, and they will reward you by revealing the best trees in their forest?</string>
<string id="1735" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You pull long white roots out of the loamy soil. They are succulent and crunchy, and your mouth feels with a sweet juice. The only unpleasant sensation is caused by the gritty soil on your teeth.</string>
<string id="1736" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You notice small yellow flowers surrounded by long narrow leaves. It must be the sundrop — and sometimes they taste as sweet as honey!</string>
<string id="1737" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You pull out a green sapling with a dirty white tangle of roots hanging underneath. You place them on your palm, and marvel at how the plant appears to have two heads. However, one of them faces Heaven, and the other, the Earth. Like a reflection in a pond.</string>
<string id="1738" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Your fingers are now impossible to tell from roots — they are covered in soil, with dirt in every skin crease and under every fingernail. You stretch out your fingers and it feels as though you have swapped your hands for a troll's paws.</string>
<string id="1739" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You place the root you have found in your mouth, but your face cringes — the taste in your mouth is as bitter as if you had just stuffed your mouth full of ashes from a funeral pyre. You spit, but the revolting taste seems to have etched itself into your mouth, and your face remains screwed up, with creases resembling the leg of an old boot.</string>
<string id="1740" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You rub the dirt away with your hands and pop the root into your mouth. The root is old and tough, and its fibers part with the greatest reluctance. Your jaws work like millstones to chew them up properly.</string>
<string id="1741" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You curse the kind of life that has made you gather those pitiful roots like some sort of a wild beast. You get worked up even more, comparing yourself to a blind mole or a slimy earthworm. But there's a void in your stomach that demands to be filled.</string>
<string id="1742" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You mumble a few prayers to the gods of fertility. If you cannot get any decent food, surely they won't begrudge you a few pathetic edible roots in their mercy?</string>
<string id="1743" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You remember your mother, who could easily tell which herb was which, and also knew how to use them. She used to say that swamp crops can be found on damp soil — in swamps and on flood plains. Rhubarb grows in damp meadows and grassy glades. Oat roots like it where it's sunny and dry. They are sweet and juicy.</string>
<string id="1744" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You hurriedly chew the thick and crunchy root. But your mouth feels like it is burning, likewise your throat. You spit out what you haven't swallowed, and furiously rub your tongue. Indeed, it's hard to tell at once whether the herb is good for humans to eat, or contains some ruddy poison! It's a good thing you haven't swallowed it all. Maybe it's not yet time to start making a grave boat.</string>
<string id="1745" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You hastily chew and swallow the roots — they are fibrous and almost tasteless, but they are the only food to be had here. However, your throat is suddenly grasped by a spasm that leads to a horrendous hacking cough. You cannot stop it and it keeps shaking your body. The accursed root is stuck somewhere inside, tickling your throat. You barely manage to finish coughing and wipe the tears from your eyes.</string>
<string id="1746" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You pull in haste, trying to make the tangled roots leave the soil, but they're still stuck, as though some underground spirit was pulling them back from the other side. You feel angered and try to grab the root deeper, and then you suddenly feel your fingernail peel away from your finger. You passionately curse the Earth and its voracious maw as you examine your hand. There it is — the index finger is naked, with no nail on it. The remaining fingernails have their outlines traced in black. They are jagged and resemble the claws of a very dirty bird.</string>
<string id="1747" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think of healers, who spend their lifetimes handling herbs and roots. From spring to autumn they gather their roots, leaves, and flowers, and during the winter they hang them up to dry. And they use them for treating the ailing folk.</string>
<string id="1748" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that it would be really nice if you came across a greater number of young roots. They may be thinner, but they sure are sweeter. Old ones are tasteless and tough as wood — you would need teeth of iron to chew them.</string>
<string id="1749" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You get a good grip on the stalk and give it a sharp yank, but leaves can be sharper than swords at times! Such a leaf can turn and give a sharp cut. You bring your palm closer and watch a crimson drop grow at the cut, and then form a trickle in the creases on your palm.</string>
<string id="1750" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You contemplate how plants grow in both directions as once. We see flowers and leaves, while the roots remain underground. Do the denizens of Netherworld also harvest them for food? Or do they walk or stalk their prey in a forest of roots?</string>
<string id="1751" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You notice that the soil always has a specific smell. It is moist with dew and underground juices, sweet and fragrant with herbs and roots, and as warm as if it were the breath of Mother Earth herself.</string>
<string id="1752" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You recall what your dear mother used to teach you: the sweet white root will give you strength. The hard and bitter one will cure ailments. And the soft yellow one will fill you up just like well-salted butter.</string>
<string id="1753" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Your stomach rumbles, demanding something more substantial than measly roots. You are trying to placate it and imagine that those crunchy things in your mouth are the bones of a young lamb and not mere roots. Or the crunchy crust of a pig roasted on a spit.</string>
<string id="1754" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You find a stone of a fitting size on the ground — gods appear to favor you today! However, when you pick up the stone, you instantly throw it away — the useless thing isn't a flint. So it isn't divine benevolence, after all — more like a mocking grin.</string>
<string id="1755" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You bend to pick up the stone. It is partially covered in dry dirt, and you try to peel it off with your fingernails. But the stone is ill-pleased, and so it scratches you with a sharp edge. The white scratch that goes all across your finger breaks your skin in two and quickly fills up with blood.</string>
<string id="1756" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You remember that healers view flint as a useful stone, too — some use hot iron to cauterize wounds, but in your land they always used powdered flint. The wounds healed in no time at all!</string>
<string id="1757" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Flints are good for a lot more than making weapons or tools. If you find a smooth and pretty stone, conceal it and wear it somewhere on the left side of your person — closer to the heart, as it were. Such a stone will make your heart brave, and your head intelligent.</string>
<string id="1758" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You remember a healer woman who recommended to always carry a flint with you — it is good for your stomach, and will protect you from poison.</string>
<string id="1759" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You recall how your mother always kept a few pieces of flint in the milk jug — an old method of keeping the milk fresh.</string>
<string id="1760" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You pick up the stone from the ground and cannot help admiring it. There is a colored concentric circle pattern, and the stone appears to be opalescent. You think that under different circumstances it could be made into a figurine or a brooch, but you will have to let that beauty go unseen.</string>
<string id="1761" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You recall how the water in the well got a musty odor — back when you were still a child and lived in your parental home. The well was plated by flint from the inside, stone by stone, and that was that. The water became clear and it even seemed to have gotten a sweeter taste.</string>
<string id="1762" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You find a large and heavy lump of flint. Just what you need! Your spirits rise, and you even begin to whistle some simple tune.</string>
<string id="1763" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You search for a suitable stone and remember that the hardest rock you can find is a flint. If you can scratch it with some other stone, it isn't flint, and you have to keep looking.</string>
<string id="1764" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You recall the phrase "hard as flint." You think of how true it is. Some people just keep on going with great resolve, without giving an inch, no matter how hard fate tries them. Flint is like that — you can scratch it, you can hit it, but it won't yield. A resilient stone.</string>
<string id="1765" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that flint is more than a mere rock. After all, does every rock produce sparks, those little golden flies? It could be that its core is golden, and that you need to know just how to split it, so that the gold doesn't disappear.</string>
<string id="1766" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look under your feet, going over the stones scattered underneath with an attentive eye. Finding the stone you need among the others is no mean feat. Your eye roams in search of a shiny side, which resembles a piece of congealed fat, which has the same dull shine in the sun.</string>
<string id="1767" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You recall how you worked together with your father. When you chip off a thin layer of flint, it is smooth and brittle. If you bring it to your eye and stare at the sun, you can sometimes just about see the sunlight coming through. That's when your father would start yelling that you shouldn't be gawking at the son — he could throw something heavy at you, too.</string>
<string id="1768" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that the fastest way to find a piece of good flint is to go to the seashore. Water has great power. It can break rocks and even grind them into flour-like particles of dust. But not flint. It is the hardiest stone of them all.</string>
<string id="1769" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You are trying to find a whole unbroken stone, without any cracks. A small burrow hole will affect the durability of the whole stone, making it worthless.</string>
<string id="1770" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look underneath your feet attentively, intent on finding a stone with smooth sides that seem polished. Such a stone brings good fortune, for it is nothing but a thunderous arrow shot from the Heavens by the Thunderer God.</string>
<string id="1771" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that a flint is just like clay in skilled hands — an experienced craftsman can easily shape a stone the way he wants. There must be some mystery to this — a secret word or some such.</string>
<string id="1772" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think it very odd that there are lands where they have never found any flint. People from over there come to pay their respects to us bringing all kinds of old stuff and shale to trade.</string>
<string id="1773" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You were looking right underneath your feet, so it is a mystery just how you managed to overlook the root protruding from underground. You trip your foot on it and fall flat on your face. Your body is buzzing all over, the scratched skin feels raw, and there's a black and blue lump ripening on your head, which is as hard as flint itself.</string>
<string id="1774" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You see a yellowish triangle on the ground that looks like a piece of butter. You pick it up, admiring the craftsman's amazing work — skilfully cut sides, and a well-sharpened tip. A great arrowhead!</string>
<string id="1775" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You anticipate how you will quench your thirst with water. It will be cold, as though born of melting ice, making your teeth ache and numbing your throat.</string>
<string id="1776" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think it might be a good idea to put a few flint stones into the waterskin, for it has been said by knowledgeable people that they have ability to purify.</string>
<string id="1777" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You are amazed by how much the water resembles the sky — when the skies darken, the waters underneath are getting murky, too. When the skies are of transparent blue hues, the waters that be upon the Earth are also peacefully cerulean. When the lakes suffer from thirst, they draw in the waters from the Heavens. For Heaven appears to be made of water. Cool blue water.</string>
<string id="1778" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">The weight of the water is dragging your arm down, and you try to get a better grip of the skin. But it is still wet — it slips out and hits the ground, making a gurgling sound. The skin's mouth opens, the water pours out and is absorbed by the earth in an instant. You kick the skin, but there's not much you can do, so you go back to fetch more water.</string>
<string id="1779" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You see a startled shoal of fish in the deep — they raise a murky muddy cloud at the bottom of the lake. You wait for the mud to settle down in order to get some clean water.</string>
<string id="1780" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You hear a large fish splash and even see a dark shadow lurking underwater. It would be great to catch it, but you won't reach that deep.</string>
<string id="1781" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look into the waterskin and see a green blade of grass on the surface of the water. You stick your finger into the skin and deftly fish it out.</string>
<string id="1782" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You take a good drink of warmish water before you realize it has a foul taste. Stale water will cause a real hurricane in your stomach!</string>
<string id="1783" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You rinse the waterskin before filling it with fresh water by pouring some water in, splashing it around, and pouring it back with a gurgling sound.</string>
<string id="1784" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Water rushes into the waterskin, displacing the air. The air rushes out in round bubbles, perturbing the water on the surface.</string>
<string id="1785" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You throw a rock into the water and marvel for the umpteenth time at how a simple rock can cause ripples on the water — vibrating circles of perfect shape that multiply, becoming wider, and then disappear.</string>
<string id="1786" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You feel the kind of chill that usually dwells near the water. You can always feel motion here — the air is fresh and never still; the surface of the water is covered in ripples, dimples, and waves. The plants that grow here are always vigorous and amaze you by their lush greenness.</string>
<string id="1787" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look into the waterskin and see that the water is murky with little particles of dirt. You have to pour out the water and immerse the waterskin into deeper water, where there will be no leaves or gnats on the surface.</string>
<string id="1788" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think of how even water always tastes different. The sweetest comes from springs, passing all the layers of the Earth on its way up. It is as though the dwarf folk that live underground poured honey into it.</string>
<string id="1789" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You ask the Water God for permission to take some water. The water god is rich and powerful — it won't beggar him for sure. But he may be ired by lack of reverence.</string>
<string id="1790" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You dip your waterskin into the water and watch the bubbles of air that come out. But you fail to notice the narrow dark shadow that rushes toward your arm to defend its home. A sudden pain makes you drop the waterskin. Water is the last thing on your mind now — the venom of a water snake is serious business.</string>
<string id="1791" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that a human being can live up to 30 moons without food, but hardly more than a few days without water. For all living things have vital juices running through them, and those need to be replenished constantly.</string>
<string id="1792" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You contemplate how ingenuously the gods have made the Earth — they splashed seawater in some places and poured fresh water in others. No matter how much the two kinds of water mix, the division remains.</string>
<string id="1793" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">As you fill your waterskin, you cup your hands, scoop up some water, and pour it over your face. You instantly feel a pleasant coolness rush over your face, washing the dust and the weariness away.</string>
<string id="1794" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You bend over the water and see your own face. It ripples, changing its expressions grotesquely, but no ripples hide the fact that your complexion resembles gray sand, and that you are haggard with fatigue and lack of sleep.</string>
<string id="1795" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You carefully peel off the bark wondering if there are any of those fat white maggots underneath. They can save one from starvation occasionally — they say the taste resembles pine nuts a little.</string>
<string id="1796" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You raise your head and it feels as though a green rain has poured over you — the wind makes a constant scattering noise, making the branches collide and the leaves rustle.</string>
<string id="1797" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">The branch gives in to your efforts and breaks, hanging limply on a strip of bark. Your nose feels the bitter smell of a wounded tree.</string>
<string id="1798" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You push the old branch aside in search of something fresher, but it rebounds, feeling slighted, and giving you a solid slap in the face. You are stunned for a few moments and feel your burning cheek in confusion.</string>
<string id="1799" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You grab onto a sturdy branch to pull yourself higher. But you feel a burning sensation in your palm and let go of the branches. There it is — a long gray track left under your skin by a splinter. Pulling it out won't be easy.</string>
<string id="1800" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You raise your head and stop in your tracks — the play of green leaves in the wind is a fascinating sight. When they flutter, showing their silvery reverse side, they are just like silver coins that you imagine pouring down on you from the Heavens.</string>
<string id="1801" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You notice a shrub with blood red berries growing at the base of the tree. Their transparent skin is bursting with red juice. You pick a few berries, pop them in your mouth and crush them with your tongue. A while later your stomach is gripped by pain — it is as if it were screaming out, claiming the juice of these berries to be similar to the poisoned milk from the black breast of a field spirit.</string>
<string id="1802" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You push aside the branches and see an enormous caterpillar with a horn on its head staring right at you. You make a grimace and feel a chill: what if it's the spirit of the tree manifesting in this form, expressing his displeasure with you for disturbing his dwelling?</string>
<string id="1803" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look at the trees and it seems to you that the spirit of the forest is hiding right behind them — you have even managed to see gray hair ruffled by the wind and dark knobbly hands.</string>
<string id="1804" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You pop a twig into your mouth and chew its narrow tip. Your mouth is filled by the bitter taste of tree bark.</string>
<string id="1805" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You dream of the summers to come, when the saplings' roots will start growing, making them vigorous and green. It is a long and painstaking activity, but its fruits are truly sweet.</string>
<string id="1806" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You try to climb higher, and pull yourself up, with your feet thrust against the trunk. One of your feet slips treacherously, and you fall on your back. The blow seems to have made your spleen trade places with your stomach, while your head rattles and hums like an empty beer barrel kicked by large men ired by their thirst.</string>
<string id="1807" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You address a heartfelt prayer to the Gods of Fertility, asking them to be generous to you and to share enough of their green goodness with you.</string>
<string id="1808" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You pray that the gods give you a good omen, and turn your face toward the sky. A white splash lands right in the middle of your forehead. A craw cackles maliciously above you, and you wonder whether the omen is good or whether the gods have mocked you by sending that vile bird.</string>
<string id="1809" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You see winding tracks in the bark — you feel as though they were arranging themselves into words. You follow them with your finger, trying to read them. But you fail to understand the will of gods — whether for good or ill.</string>
<string id="1810" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You place your palm on the rough bark, feeling its warmth with your skin, and you appear to sense the immobile tree living and breathing nevertheless.</string>
<string id="1811" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think of how the tree is the source of life and how it nurtures and supports it, and then provides you with the bed that will take you on your last sea voyage…</string>
<string id="1812" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You loosen your fingers in order to get a better grip on the branches, but there's a sudden complication — a narrow cleft in the bark won't let your fingers go. You pull and twist your hand until your fingers are released, red and swollen.</string>
<string id="1813" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You reach out your hand to take a branch, but it stings your fingers maliciously. A twig that looks like a long thorn has ripped your skin open rather nastily.</string>
<string id="1814" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You touch the bark and think of how rough and solid it is — a far cry from the soft human skin. You think to yourself, "It figures — a tree has no shelter from rain or frost."</string>
<string id="1815" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You pry up the bark, and a large sheet peels off, which you receive gladly. A great piece!</string>
<string id="1816" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You try to hack off a sizable piece of the tree's skin, but it feels as though it were armored. You make too hard an effort and cut your finger, and now you have to spend some time to take care of the wound and stop the bleeding.</string>
<string id="1817" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You see the grooves in the bark form a complex wavy pattern and try to take a closer look at them. You are surprised — you see clear knife marks. What was whoever had left them trying to write? Their name? Or a plea for help? Could it be a warning of some sort of danger?</string>
<string id="1818" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You remember how your mother used to collect bark from young branches. She was a skilled healer and used her brews and infusions to treat everyone's ailments, be it burns, joint aches, or sprained tendons.</string>
<string id="1819" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look at the tree and think about the unbreakable link between the bitter smell of the bark, its brownish-gray color and dry crackly texture, and the roughness you feel when you touch it.</string>
<string id="1820" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You are completely engrossed in your work and it takes you a while to realize just what it was that had just fallen on your head with so much noise. You jump aside, startled, and rub your hurting head. There is a large club-like branch on the ground. The tree spirit probably doesn't like your company.</string>
<string id="1821" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Your industriousness is punished by the tree — it throws a small twig right into your eye. You leap aside and blink furiously. The bark is the least of your worries now — all you want is to get the twig out of your eye, which looks like a waterfall of tears.</string>
<string id="1822" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">The bark peels off, and a cloud of dust appears in the space underneath. It reaches your nostrils, and you sneeze thunderously.</string>
<string id="1823" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that it's best to peel bark right after the rain, when it soaks up some water and peels from the body of the tree easily.</string>
<string id="1824" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You slap the tree trunk — you have a feeling that its bark will be perfect for making bowls and mugs.</string>
<string id="1825" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You peel off the bark thinking that the best kind of kindling you can get is the bark of a birch tree. Should even that fail to start a fire, you have a special trick: the pieces of birch bark need to form a triangular mound.</string>
<string id="1826" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that you can fashion a mug out of the bark — simple, yet elegant in its own way: of a deep yellow hue, just like butter. Or the sun during the last third of the day.</string>
<string id="1827" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that bark requires special treatment, unless you intend to use it for kindling — you must oil it to keep it supple. Or soak it in water, at the very least.</string>
<string id="1828" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look at the rough patterns on the bark and remember how there'd be boxes and lidded baskets made of birch in every household back home. Those were wrought very finely — there were patterned belts along the top and the bottom.</string>
<string id="1829" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You study the piece of bark and think that the only thing you can make is a mug of the simplest sort. But your land sure had skilled craftsmen — they could even make containers you could use to boil water, no less! And just to think of the decorations — all those painted, cut-out, and filed-out ornaments.</string>
<string id="1830" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You muse that you have never seen any larches on the island. Those are best for all kinds of containers and utensils — the wood doesn't crack or split.</string>
<string id="1831" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that with some trees you can only use the bark for making containers. The birch bark, for instance, can be used for almost anything — you can use it to make a bowl, if that's what you need, or, say, a ladle!</string>
<string id="1832" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You feel the bark and think the rumor you heard about the nomads that had roamed along the southern borders of the Empire until recently — apparently, they have this custom of covering all their bark vessels with thick layers of butter or cream. Fancy wasting food on that! You can do without it perfectly well.</string>
<string id="1833" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You focus your eyes on the roots — it seems as though you can see something unusual among them. You were right! With a cry of joy, you pocket your extileent find!</string>
<string id="1834" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">As you estimate the amount of work required, you pick a piece of sticky resin up with your fingernail and pop it into your mouth. It's more fun to work when your jaws have something to do.</string>
<string id="1835" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look at a gray toad that has crawled out onto one of the roots. You pry it up with your foot and you toss it aside — its pimply skin looks revolting. You wonder whether there is any truth to the rumor that you can find a gemstone inside a toad's head.</string>
<string id="1836" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Sweat is pouring into your eyes. You stop to rub it off with your hand.</string>
<string id="1837" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You turn your palms upwards and cringe as you blow on them. They're all covered in blisters and cracks, and they won't let you get much work done.</string>
<string id="1838" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think of tree roots reaching so far underground that no human can ever reach. Maybe the water they drink comes from the very source of wisdom.</string>
<string id="1839" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You suddenly see an old mark on the bark that has already healed. You wonder who could have marked their way here in such a manner. Someone from mainland, perhaps? Or the natives? A chill runs down your spine.</string>
<string id="1840" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You pretend to be a mighty warrior battling with a giant monster. Your sword pierces the wooden flesh, chopping off tentacles. Severed limbs convulse, and the monster dies right at your feet.</string>
<string id="1841" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You are concerned about the wind — it might be too strong. If the wind joins forces with the tree, they can play an evil trick on you by squashing you like a bug when you least expect it.</string>
<string id="1842" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You examine the trunk to find out just where to start chopping. If the tree is bent or crooked, it's much easier.</string>
<string id="1843" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You don't mess around with trees — when something that big falls on someone, he'll be squashed like a grape!</string>
<string id="1844" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You mark the place of the first cut. Once the cut is made, you take it out just like a slice of a pie, and then you fell the tree in that direction.</string>
<string id="1845" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that it's hard to do this without a helper. You could obviously use some assistance in pulling the rope and pushing the trunk.</string>
<string id="1846" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You cut the branches from the side the tree will fall onto — it will weigh less, and you will be safe from flying wood chips.</string>
<string id="1847" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">It would, of course, be easier to climb the tree and then start felling it from the top. But there's a saying that you shouldn't cut the branch you're sitting on.</string>
<string id="1848" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You try to remember when it last rained. A moist tree is heavy, and its trunk is slippery. It will be much harder in that case.</string>
<string id="1849" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You put your hand on the rough bark and ask the spirits of the forest and the earth to forgive you for taking away one of their kin.</string>
<string id="1850" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Now isn't that a pretty stump! You could put some dinnerware on and sit down to eat right away. Just like a table, I swear!</string>
<string id="1851" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Uprooting stumps is hard — worse than any forced labor. First you need to dig a trench around it, and then you must cut off the roots. You'll know the true meaning of "weary" by the time it is over!</string>
<string id="1852" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You have dug a trench around the stump, but it's still rooted solidly in the earth. You sit down on it to catch a breather. It would be more convenient to pry it up with a stick, and then to use it like a lever. It would probably fly up like a stone from a slingshot.</string>
<string id="1853" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You bend down over the cutting and inhale the very essence of the forest with your nostrils. It smells of wood, moss, and fungal rot.</string>
<string id="1854" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You trace the rough texture of the cut with your finger, studying the sequence of rings — dark and light, wide and narrow, admiring the great age of the felled tree.</string>
<string id="1855" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look at the stump and it looks to you just like a giant octopulos with its tentacles deep underground, holding tightly onto a treasure chest and absolutely refusing to let go. No matter how deep you dig or how fiercely you chop.</string>
<string id="1856" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You feel reluctant to strain your back by uprooting the stump. You think that, perhaps, you should burn it.</string>
<string id="1857" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You rub your lower back — the last thing you need is to rupture your back and spend weeks convalescing.</string>
<string id="1858" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">What an enormous tree it was! Not even two people together could get their arms around the trunk!</string>
<string id="1859" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Come on already, open that tentacle grip of yours! See how hard it holds on! It must be sucking the blood of Mother Earth. But they won't do you much good now that your head's been cut off!</string>
<string id="1860" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">The wood shavings fly merrily in every direction — it is as though small beetles disturbed by the saw were leaving their dwelling.</string>
<string id="1861" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Toward you and then away, toward you — and away. The monotony of these repetitive actions is making you melancholy. It looks like the ritual dance of those wild steppe tribes when they try to make it rain.</string>
<string id="1862" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You examine the log from both sides. What if you approach from the other end? It seems as though it might be easier this way.</string>
<string id="1863" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You pull the saw toward yourself and rub your palm on the log. It feels as if it were licked by a dragon's rough tongue of stone. You take a good look at your hand and see that the skin is raw and bleeding.</string>
<string id="1864" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">The saw makes a singing sound and jumps away from the log. You try to get it started once again, but it bends and jumps away once more. You quickly mumble a prayer to guard yourself against the trickery of evil spirits and get back to work.</string>
<string id="1865" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You feel a sudden sting. You bring your hand closer to your eyes to take a closer look and see a splinter in your palm. Although this is no mere splinter — it looks more like a large chip of wood driven about half an inch deep into your palm.</string>
<string id="1866" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">The saw mark on the log reminds you of a grin. You tell the tree that it is free to mock all it wants. We'll see who gets to laugh in the end!</string>
<string id="1867" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">A single awkward movement makes you stop. You kick the log angrily — its hard fibers have bent the saw, and you will now have to waste your precious time on fixing it.</string>
<string id="1868" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You feel the log thinking of how dry wood is harder than wet wood. However, even though it is easier to saw a wet log, the wet sawdust clings to the saw and steals away its power and speed.</string>
<string id="1869" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">The harsh and vibrating sound made by the saw cuts through the silence, rings in your ears, and scares away the birds that sat nearby.</string>
<string id="1870" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You've had bad luck with the log. It is hard and crooked, and the saw sinks in it as though the wood were a swamp.</string>
<string id="1871" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You realize you had approached this task wrong from the very start, and now the handle of the saw has rubbed your hand raw. You look for something to use as a bandage lest you leave all your skin on the handle.</string>
<string id="1872" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You recall old men mentioning a special tree whose roots go all the way down to a holy sanctum deep underground. The tree was supposed to bear fruit that would give anyone who ate it the knowledge of many hidden things. You cut your daydream short by reminding yourself that you cannot fell that tree with a simple axe or an ordinary saw…</string>
<string id="1873" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You place your palm on the rough surface of the tree and remember that all trees drink juices from underground, which means god himself imbues them with strength. You whisper your thanks to the god for his permission to take one of his trees.</string>
<string id="1874" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You remember what your father would say about labor of any sort: "Eyes may fear, but the hands will still steer." He was right, of course — all things are difficult before they are easy.</string>
<string id="1875" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You remember your father, who would always say: "A man's strength is in his work." You shouldn't idle about while there's still work to be done.</string>
<string id="1876" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You like the smell of resin that comes from the tree. You pry a piece of opaque resin from the bark and pop it into your mouth. It has a pleasant woody taste with strong pine-needle notes.</string>
<string id="1877" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You dig a shallow pit for the little tree — this way, the roots will find air quicker. You cannot help comparing the pit to a cozy little house.</string>
<string id="1878" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You have planted the sapling, and are now tilling the soil around it — it will be more comfortable and easier for the young roots to breathe this way.</string>
<string id="1879" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You take a look at your little tree and remove the broken branches, weak and helpless. They will not revive, at any rate, but they will take away some of the plant's vital juices.</string>
<string id="1880" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think of manure and how nice it would be to mix some with the soil to keep the roots warm and well-nourished.</string>
<string id="1881" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You choose a small hillock to plant your sapling. Your grandfather already knew this, and he passed the knowledge on to you: the soil on such mounds is more nutritious; there's also more air, and a smaller chance that excess moisture will cause root rot.</string>
<string id="1882" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You examine the little tree — it knows where it wants to grow. The darker side has to face the south, and the lighter side will face the darker side of the sky.</string>
<string id="1883" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You plant the sapling and stomp around to make sure the ground is compact. Now you can take a breather.</string>
<string id="1884" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You utter a short prayer for the God of the Netherworld, who watches over everything that happens underground, would make the roots grow better and give vigor to the trunk.</string>
<string id="1885" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You examine your tree and gently remove the leaves, taking care not to damage the burgeons. The sapling doesn't need them yet, and all they do is squander water.</string>
<string id="1886" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You plant the sapling and are now looking at your hand — there is a piece of bark deep under one of your fingernails. The finger hurts and you're trying to pry the splinter loose, but to no avail. You think that if you stick about a hundred such splinters under someone's fingernails, that will amount to proper torture.</string>
<string id="1887" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You have tried to choose sturdy trees for planting. After all, a rotten root bears no sweet fruit.</string>
<string id="1888" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Before you plant the sapling, you carefully slice a piece of one of its side roots. You look at the clear white cut with pleasure — the root is alive and healthy. A dry root would have been brown.</string>
<string id="1889" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You touch the little trunk with your hand and think that trees have real healing power. Healers know which trees cure ailments, which fill one's body with strength, and which make sure the head thinks pleasant thoughts.</string>
<string id="1890" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">They say there's a tree that is a thousand times stronger than these — wider and taller. But has anyone seen it? It is said to be guarded by wild beasts who tear apart anyone who dares to approach. But if there are no living witnesses, who can testify to the tree's existence?</string>
<string id="1891" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You make a vow: if the tree lives, you will bury its first fruit in the ground to express your gratitude to God.</string>
<string id="1892" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You want to cover the roots with soil, but suddenly notice something in the pit. You reach for it and pick up a strange object.</string>
<string id="1893" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You recall your father's special method of planting trees. He would plant them in such a way that they would protect the house from the wind, as well as summer heat.</string>
<string id="1894" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You run your hand over the grass and cringe — a sharp blade of grass that looks like a double-edge sword has cut your palm.</string>
<string id="1895" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You see something that doesn't look like either a rock or a pile of leaves in the grass. You bend down and pick up a very interesting item.</string>
<string id="1896" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You make a heavy step and notice that you've stepped on a serpent's tail when it's already too late. The reptile is long enough to bend over backwards and drive a venomous tooth into your leg. You crush the snake's head with your other foot, but what you need to do first and foremost is remove the poison from your body.</string>
<string id="1897" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You pick up a pale pink flower and crush the petals in your fingers. A pleasant tangy smell reaches your nostril. You think it would be nice to gather some of them and use them to brew a bracing beverage that's very good for you.</string>
<string id="1898" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You see fragrant white flowers in the grass. You aren't tempted by the smell — you know that if you spend a few minutes near them, you'll get a headache.</string>
<string id="1899" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You take a deep breath. You breathe in a special kind of air that smells of wet earth and fresh grass, with a slight aroma of flowers.</string>
<string id="1900" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You touch the serrated leaves and remember that this plant's flowers can only be seen once a year, so who has ever seen them? This flower can float in the air and lead you to buried treasure. That's why it doesn't reveal itself to just anyone.</string>
<string id="1901" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You bend down to see whether the mushroom is maggoty. You recall the words of your mother about every mushroom being edible. All you need to know is how to cook it right.</string>
<string id="1902" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You draw the leaves apart and your hand touches a bush that's all covered in thorns. One of the thorns pricks your finger, and you suck out a droplet of blood — you never know whether or not the bush might be poisonous.</string>
<string id="1903" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look deep into the grass, trying to find yellow berries. They are watery and rather bland, but they remind you of home.</string>
<string id="1904" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You saw an unusual plant. Its jagged leaves resemble flames of fire. Or the ornaments on the attire of the northerners.</string>
<string id="1905" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You see a strange plant — its leaves are rolled into narrow tubes, and the flowers have shiny white petals. You break off the stalk — maybe you'll get a chance to show it to someone who knows what this plant is and what properties it has.</string>
<string id="1906" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You pick up a branch and start waving it around as though it were a sword. You strike left and right, scattering the flowers, which fall on the ground. You shake your "sword" victoriously, and then you shake your head — such juvenile behavior.</string>
<string id="1907" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">An unpleasant smell reaches your nostrils, and your experienced eye notices off-white bell-like flowers amidst the grass. You recognize these flowers — their juice makes cow milk taste revolting. Should a cow be stupid enough to eat a lot of them, it will behave like mad, and may even gore its owner with its horns.</string>
<string id="1908" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You see the plant you need, but you refrain from picking it. Its leaves are rolled into tubes, with white cobwebs all over. The caterpillars have managed to beat you to it, and now the plant is only edible to the insect folk.</string>
<string id="1909" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You are amazed by the sheer variety of grasses. There are hundreds of hues and smells, and they are making your head spin. You stop. Then you realize that your head is spinning because of the vapors of jimsonweed, and that you need some fresh air to chase them away.</string>
<string id="1910" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You draw the grass apart and jerk your hand back — it feels as if you touched a flame. You see how the poisonous sap is making your hand burn, redden, and get covered in small blisters.</string>
<string id="1911" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">The hundreds and hundreds of grasses underneath your feet exude an unbelievable smell. You tear off the head of a flower and chew it slowly, feeling the taste of honey on your tongue.</string>
<string id="1912" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You pick the herb you need, only to notice the plant is dry, with withered leaves and a brittle stalk. You crush it in your hands and scatter the fragments to the wind.</string>
<string id="1913" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">An unassuming bug jumps onto your hand. You thoughtlessly flick it away, and the strong odor informs you that you have just chased away a shield bug. Its acrid stench will now accompany you halfway to your destination at least.</string>
<string id="1914" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You bend down to break away a stalk at the very base, but a tiny striped warrior attacks you. You recognize it as a wasp, and angrily rub the sting. Your hand itches and swells up in an ugly red patch.</string>
<string id="1915" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You watch out for the stalks and leaves, but you also keep in mind the roots, which you dig out. You hope to find the Root of Life — it grows from the very depths of the Earth, and the Great God himself is said to give it power.</string>
<string id="1916" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You try to wave away a pesky fly that keeps getting into your face, and accidentally touch the grass, whose sharp tongues grow tall, facing the sky. The long green blade slices your finger open like any knife.</string>
<string id="1917" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You pick a leaf of grass and pop the narrow edge into your mouth. You crush the narrow stalk with your teeth, sucking out the sweet sap.</string>
<string id="1918" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You see a handful of red berries right next to the ground. They may not be very juicy, but they're very sweet. This is typical for open places in the sun, as you note.</string>
<string id="1919" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You draw the green grass apart and see a large beetle with an ugly horn on its snout. You think that the monster is watching you, and has even lowered its head menacingly. You spit angrily and let the grass spring back to cover up the beetle. You are not afraid — far from it — but what if it's an evil spirit guarding its territory.</string>
<string id="1920" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look under your feet, and your heart fills with joy — you have found a rare ingredient!</string>
<string id="1921" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Your hand reaches for the ripe grapes as though it were moving of its own accord. You swallow one grape after another, but, before you even finish the last one, you feel your face and hands begin to itch. You suddenly feel a chill inside — someone must have cursed you!</string>
<string id="1922" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You stop to take a deep breath. The smell of the herbs and the flowers makes you dizzy and fills your soul with joy at the same time. You could praise all the gods right now.</string>
<string id="1923" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that someday you will find your recipe for immortality. You have thought out the recipe of the potion in great detail, but there is still something missing — doubtlessly, some small and very rare herb…</string>
<string id="1924" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that you are really close to your own recipe for transforming rocks into gold. You were almost lucky once, and the rock even took on a yellow hue, but the magic vanished in the light of day. However, you're not a quitter and hope to fill your purse with gold ingots of your own someday.</string>
<string id="1925" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You sort through the herbs and notice that your hands are green and emit a pleasant herbal smell.</string>
<string id="1926" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think irritatedly that your fingers have grown completely rough from all the work, and it's really hard for you to pick thin stalks and the heads of small flowers.</string>
<string id="1927" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You recall having invented the potion of youth a long time ago, when you were still a lad — you even managed to test it on your old nanny. She complained the drink did her no good, and even had to spend the whole night sitting in the bushes. But you saw how her face, which had looked like a baked turnip, became really smooth by the morning. She claims the accursed drink made her face swell up, but you know the truth.</string>
<string id="1928" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You feel the stalks, but they're not supple enough and rather dry — they won't be useful to you.</string>
<string id="1929" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You raise your face to the trees — sometimes they are all covered in sturdy green ropes. These parasitic vines are just what you need — as good as any rope.</string>
<string id="1930" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You try to estimate whether the stalks you have found are strong enough by stretching them hard. You nod approvingly — these should do.</string>
<string id="1931" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You remember how one of your uncles, who wasn't particularly fond of work, made one of his tools out of an old root. So what happened next? Obviously enough, they wore out quickly, and the stone fell out. The uncle lost his axe as well as one of his toes.</string>
<string id="1932" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You casually pick a red berry from a bush and toss it in your mouth. Sweeter than honey!</string>
<string id="1933" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You are going through the types of knots you know in your mind, thinking of which of them would be best to use on the threads. The woman's knot isn't called this for nothing — it is only fit for tying head-scarves. A weaver's knot or a cow's knot will hold much better.</string>
<string id="1934" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You notice a suitable stalk and grab it deftly. But it proves harder than you thought — it holds fast, and you need some effort. The tough old stalk breaks with a loud crack, and you fly like a missile from the catapult, landing on your back and raising a cloud of dust from the grass. You get up groaning and rubbing your aching back.</string>
<string id="1935" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that hemp fiber is the best material for a rope. Hair is good, too, likewise woven tendons.</string>
<string id="1936" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that you have finally found a fitting material, but notice a spider's web nearby. You pick up the cobweb and use it to wipe your hands — it has been known since times immemorial that a spider's thread makes one's hands strong and agile.</string>
<string id="1937" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You bend down and notice that the grass and the rocks aren't the only things you see under your feet. You think you have found something quite extraordinary.</string>
<string id="1938" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Your long stride is broken by a root protruding from the ground. You flutter your hands as if you were trying to get airborne, but the miracle does not happen. You fall down like a heavy sack. Now you know what it really means to knock the breath out of someone.</string>
<string id="1939" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">One of your earliest childhood memories is of ships entering the harbor, well-cured by the wind and the sea. Swarthy tanned sailors hoist down all sorts of goods — sometimes the children gawking from underneath get their hands on something, too. An overripe exotic fruit, a darkened piece of wood, or an extremely strong piece of rope from the rigging.</string>
<string id="1940" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You pull on the threads, but they're taut as hard as a bowstring and cut your palm with ease. You clench your fist and see a trickle of blood come out.</string>
<string id="1941" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You recollect how they used to weave rope in the days of your — the plants were dried, soaked, and then broken and scutched by the women. Then they would heckle and card it, and only after than they could start weaving a rope.</string>
<string id="1942" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think some nettle would come in handy — you can use it to make strong and durable rope. All you need to do is find tall plants. Then you have to remove the leaves and make a cut lengthwise — not too deep, but not too shallow, either.</string>
<string id="1943" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that if you fail to find a suitable material, bark will do, too. If you slice it up in long thin strips, it is also usable.</string>
<string id="1944" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You remember how your mother's agile fingers would expertly crush dried threads, spin them, twist them, and pull them between the thumb and the back of a knife. It's common knowledge — the cleaner the threads, the stronger the rope.</string>
<string id="1945" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that you could make a fitting rope if you came across some hemp. All you need to do is to choose a female plant. Male plants are more suitable for making fabric.</string>
<string id="1946" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You try to choose a vigorous plant with a thick stalk — it will probably bear replanting easier.</string>
<string id="1947" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You say the magic words to make the spirits of the forest take heed of you. You cannot so much as pick a flower or crush a blade of grass without their leave.</string>
<string id="1948" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You keep searching, but you fail to notice a tree's sharp claw reaching for you. Your face gets covered in scratches in an instant. Yet you are happy that you have managed to protect your eyes.</string>
<string id="1949" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Wow! What could this be? You bend down and pick up something one doesn't usually find in the forest.</string>
<string id="1950" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that with gardening you never can tell what the result will be. Maybe you just shouldn't bother… Then you recall your mother's succulent apple pies, or her rhubarb pie… Ah well, pies are worth the effort.</string>
<string id="1951" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You are thinking of the Goddess of Fertility, whom you have to placate — nothing grows without her leave, not even the nettles by the side of the road.</string>
<string id="1952" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You rub your neck. Staring into the ground all the time is strenuous — even a neck of steel would break eventually.</string>
<string id="1953" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You see a beetle lying helpless on its back. "What a clumsy creature!" you think as you poke the beetle with a stick. Once the beetle gets hopeful and grabs onto it with its feet, you flick it down to the ground. The beetle is on the ground again, trying hard to open its wings. You laugh out loud — that was a funny joke.</string>
<string id="1954" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You hear a deafening crackle and stop in your tracks. Cold sweat runs down your back. What could it be?! A bear… or a boar? Or the spirits of the forest coming to get you? One of the natives with a poisoned spear hiding in the bushes? All is silent… You realize the crack came from the twig you have stepped on.</string>
<string id="1955" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You see a fitting plant and pull it by the stalk instead of digging it out. That wasn't a good idea! The rough stalk scrapes the palms of your hands raw.</string>
<string id="1956" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You notice some horsetail. It's an extremely verminous plant — you cannot drive it out or pull it out. But it may not be as useless as people think… They say horsetails guard gold.</string>
<string id="1957" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You are thinking of digging up some of those bushes with pumpkin-colored flowers — an infusion of those makes wounds heal much faster. And the small magenta ones are good against cough.</string>
<string id="1958" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that all the plants get their juices from the Earth. And Mother Earth must be getting her power from the Dreamer who sleeps within her.</string>
<string id="1959" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Once I finish planting, I'll read a prayer in every corner and bury some charmed plants her to make sure those voracious beetles leave the green leaves well alone.</string>
<string id="1960" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You are concerned about moles — those pests can dig up the plants' roots, suffocating them.</string>
<string id="1961" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You remember how back home you had to call the priests, and they would determine whether or not you could plant anything. They should know better — after all, they ask permission from the gods for everything.</string>
<string id="1962" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You have failed to notice old yellow nettles. They sting your hand, even though they have already withered. The older a nettle, the sharper its teeth.</string>
<string id="1963" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You see a plant with unfamiliar jagged leaves and large red berries. This plant doesn't resemble any of those known to you. You break off a branch to dry it and show it to a knowledgeable person whenever you get the chance.</string>
<string id="1964" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You see some crimson berries hiding among the leaves. You hastily toss them into your mouth — their juice quenches thirst perfectly.</string>
<string id="1965" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You feel something sting your ankle painfully. As you thought — you didn't give the reptile the right-of-way, and it retaliated immediately.</string>
<string id="1966" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You draw the tree branches apart in search of cocoons and think of the amazing talent of the caterpillars — to create sliding threads that are nearly weightless.</string>
<string id="1967" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You examine the branches in hopes of finding a cocoon, thinking the fabric that glistens in the sun does not necessarily have to be worn by kings. These days every peasant can dress in glorious silk — all you need to know is how to unravel the caterpillars' cocoons.</string>
<string id="1968" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You cannot yet claim a good yield of silkworm cocoons, but you already imagine how you will dunk them in boiling water and then start unraveling the softened cocoons. Thin, near-invisible threads will stay on your fingers.</string>
<string id="1969" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look at the branches and wonder who may have thought of taking threads from caterpillars first. Darned if you know! The old emperor is said to have bought the secret for a few chests of gold! Or, perhaps, the nomads from the south were the first to have thought of it.</string>
<string id="1970" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You take a look at the tree, thinking that butterflies born in palaces of silk are rather unsightly — grayish wings, rather dull, looking like a large moth.</string>
<string id="1971" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that the butterfly that you noticed in front of you was a mulberry silkmoth. You are trying to see where it is headed in case you see some cocoons. You would like to catch it and find out whether it's true that butterfly mouths are sealed and they never eat during their winged life.</string>
<string id="1972" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Even though you did notice a butterfly, you keep on looking for cocoons. You know that silkmoths can breed several times during a summer, so the same tree can have butterflies, caterpillars, and cocoons on it.</string>
<string id="1973" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You remember seeing trees with all leaves devoured by silkworms. Those caterpillars are extremely voracious, and eat leaves the way fire eats wood.</string>
<string id="1974" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You find a tight white cocoon and are examining it. You are amazed with the diligence of these little weavers — it can take them four days to build a house of threads, tirelessly shaking their head from side to side.</string>
<string id="1975" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that even in case of silkworms males work harder than females. Males make tidy and thick cocoons, whereas females tend to slack off.</string>
<string id="1976" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You find some cocoons and place them on your palm. They are white, with a rough feel, and very light — they look like the eggs of some forest bird.</string>
<string id="1977" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You haven't found any cocoons here, but there are lots of berries on the tree, large and fragrant. Their sweet juice fills your mouth.</string>
<string id="1978" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You see something white on the tree and you remove it from the leaf. You see a cocoon of a regular caterpillar — utterly worthless. You crush the cocoon in your hand and a greenish liquid comes out.</string>
<string id="1979" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You try to push the branch away, and it scratches your face with its claws. You rub your cheek with your hand — there must certainly be a red mark there.</string>
<string id="1980" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">It occurs to you that silkworms have a fine taste, what with them feeding on mulberry leaves. The berries that grow on these trees are also fine — you can use them to make a tincture that will chase every ailment right out of your body at once!</string>
<string id="1981" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You scratch the back of your head wondering whether you really need those cocoons that badly. You'll have to gather a mind-boggling number of chrysalises to get a cut of cloth!</string>
<string id="1982" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You remember your father's lessons — he showed you little young growth on the mulberry and said that if you see such shoots, the year will definitely be a warm one.</string>
<string id="1983" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You pick a chrysalis from a branch, thinking that you must by no means let the butterfly hatch. Its noxious saliva will burn a hole in the cocoon, rendering it worthless.</string>
<string id="1984" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You suddenly find yourself musing on what kind of threads the gods use for measuring out our fates. Or could it be to each their own — flaxen threads for the peasants, wool for the warriors, and silk for the king?</string>
<string id="1985" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You stare in confusion and then recollect that whenever you see an open wound, you have to cauterize it with red-hot iron. Otherwise the body around it will blacken and deaden. And then the blackness will spread to the rest of the body.</string>
<string id="1986" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Oh dear! At any rate, you need to use a liquid that kills all illnesses. You should wipe it with urine. Drinking a urine tincture wouldn't hurt, either, but there's no one to make it here…</string>
<string id="1987" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You hurry to help, but you don't know where to begin. Healers have something that works against pain! What could it be? Belladonna or opium usually, but there's nowhere to procure either right now!</string>
<string id="1988" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">The only thing you remember is how to treat a wound left by a poisoned arrow or javelin. You cauterize it with iron, and then seal the wound with wax. That's the surest cure.</string>
<string id="1989" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">A talisman would come in handy just now — an iron rectangle with symbols written upon it. You remember how this amulet saved your life with something other than magic once — it shattered the arrowhead that would have ended up piercing your chest otherwise!</string>
<string id="1990" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Dear old mother was so good at bandaging people! I wish I could remember what she taught me!</string>
<string id="1991" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look at the body in front of you perplexedly. Where do you begin? A spell against wounds? Or tying a damaged limb to a stick? Or should you use red-hot iron?</string>
<string id="1992" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You recollect what few things you know about healing: the first thing to do with a wound is to suck out the blood. If a bone is broken, you should tie it to a stick. If the soul has left the body, you should burn some hair or a bone near the nose.</string>
<string id="1993" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">That's nothing! Some were chopped in half in such a way that the head would still blink its eyes while the feet had already run their last. The guy had no idea there was just half of him left, and you kept mum, too.</string>
<string id="1994" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think you've seen worse things in your life! Just to recall the wholesale slaughter of the first battles for the Empire's eastern borders. The ground ran red with blood, and the crows flew over the wounded like a black cloud, but even their cawing was drowned out by the yells and the groans… It is as though the rocks had opened up, and everyone was given a glimpse of hell.</string>
<string id="1995" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">All right, you take care! You'll live until you die — that thing should heal in no time!</string>
<string id="1996" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">The Eastern reaches, now — that was something else! They attacked and, by golly, they crushed our army! I still remember how they galloped on, with their horses ramming through our ranks, and how their hooves crushed skulls like eggshells.</string>
<string id="1997" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Our sawbones was really something! He'd give you a stick to chew on and start twisting your limbs into shape. And is the arm or a leg was beyond healing, he'd just chop it off with an axe, and that was that. Some would grind their teeth into powder with that stick — not everyone can pull through something like that.</string>
<string id="1998" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">It is unpleasant, of course, but nothing that couldn't be fixed. You should have seen this guy who had half his head smashed with a stone from a slingshot — you could even see his mashed brains. He didn't seem to mind too much — he even smiled.</string>
<string id="1999" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">A nice drink to warm you up, that's what we need — the spirits will instantly spread through your blood, making your body hale and your spirit merry!</string>
<string id="2000" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You must have felt icy paws scratching deep inside? That's fine — we'll burn them with fire, and let them search for another soul!</string>
<string id="2001" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">This is nothing compared to what I've seen with my own eyes! Some would have their stomachs slashed open, with their guts falling into the dust. Others had their heads chopped off — the head flies some 20 feet away, and the body drops down right there next to you. There's nothing you can do but press on and try to avoid blinking.</string>
<string id="2002" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">If you let every wind drop you down like that, you won't get anywhere. Pull yourself together — we'll have mead at their funeral yet!</string>
<string id="2003" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You stretch out your feet, thinking it would be really nice to stretch them towards a bright fire… The warmth would spread through your body, and there would be steam coming from your wet clothes…</string>
<string id="2004" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You sit down and stretch with great relish, and then scratch with gusto. Isn't it nice to relax sometimes!</string>
<string id="2005" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You stretch so hard your joints crackle, and give a wide yawn. The weary muscles are filling with languor.</string>
<string id="2006" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You stretch out your feet and wiggle your toes. You think that a comfortable pair of shoes would come in handy — you could make them, perhaps, or maybe someone will trade you a pair. You dream of strong brown leather softly gripping your foot, with snug-fitting straps on top.</string>
<string id="2007" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Some lunch sure wouldn't be amiss now! Smoky pork and sweet-smelling bread hot from the oven, washed down by a good swig of beer… Food of the gods. You wallow in your daydream with your eyes shut tight in anticipation.</string>
<string id="2008" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Isn't it nice to sit down like that? you think to yourself. "I don't really feel like I'm myself when I haven't had any rest."</string>
<string id="2009" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">The moment you sit down like that, all sorts of things occur to you. Do gods observe you every moment, and if they do, where were they looking when you cut your finger with a knife a few days ago? And is it true there are rivers underground just like ours, and also cities? And does the Sacred Tree really support all nine worlds upon itself?</string>
<string id="2010" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You sit down and press your palms against the ground — you hope the God of the Netherworld will share some of his power with you this way.</string>
<string id="2011" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You shut your eyes for a moment, thinking to yourself that you shouldn't fall asleep. But the sleep glues your eyelids together better than any wax, and you begin to doze off.</string>
<string id="2012" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You rub your shoulders thinking you could do with some better clothes.</string>
<string id="2013" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think of how pleasant it is to spend time with others from time to time — to sit by the fire, telling tall tales, and recalling things that happened in your glorious past.</string>
<string id="2014" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You see an ant on the ground, hurrying about its own business. You wonder how such a small ant can have enough strength to carry a straw that is ten times heavier. Does it rely on higher powers? You gingerly lift the straw with your thumb and forefinger to lighten the insect's burden. But the ant drops the straw — apparently, it is accustomed to take care of everything by itself or with the aid of its kin.</string>
<string id="2015" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You pick up a wood chip with your fingers and start doodling on the ground. You look at the doodles as though they were symbols that you can decipher.</string>
<string id="2016" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look at your hands and see wiry veins covering the backs of your hands like rivers of blue. Hard work spares no one — your skin gets rough, your arms get veined, and you get black grime underneath your fingernails.</string>
<string id="2017" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You remember what your father used to say: "Find time for work, but be sure to leave an hour for leisure." The wise old man knew life well.</string>
<string id="2018" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Your heart seems to be skipping beats in your chest like a small fluttering bird flinging itself against your ribs as though they were the bars of a cage. You really have to take a break — you've been working non-stop and are now feeling like a horse that's been ridden down.</string>
<string id="2019" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You like to just sit there and daydream without being disturbed. You can dream of so many things — for instance, you can dream you are someone else; someone with lands and cattle, for example. All you have to do is wave a hand if you want a chalice of mead — or someone to scratch your heels. You wave your hand in a commanding manner, forgetting there is no one there to rush to your beckon.</string>
<string id="2020" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You take the chance offered by your momentary respite and fish a pebble that you found in the evening out of the folds of your clothes. It is a worthless pebble by any account — fit to be a child's toy and little else; and yet it is too beautiful and too smooth, and cannot help wanting to roll it in your fingers. You admire the intricate pattern of stripes on its sides, as smooth as if they were polished.</string>
<string id="2021" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You rub your eyelids hard with your fingers — your eyes must be tired, or the wind may have blown some sand into them. Your eyelids remain shut, but you still see the wobbly black and orange circles left by finger pressure.</string>
<string id="2022" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You examine the ground in order to check for fresh tracks — perhaps some light paws have left their prints somewhere.</string>
<string id="2023" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">It occurs to you that it would be easier to set a second trap for small prey than to go hunting. A trap can save a lot of effort!</string>
<string id="2024" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You set your trap and think that catching an animal requires a lot of patience. The beast has to get used to the place, smell everything, and eventually decide everything is safe…</string>
<string id="2025" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You mark the place where you set the trap and think you should check it more often. Sometimes you fail to check the trap in due time, and the hare or the quail has already escaped! Either that, or it got eaten by a larger beast.</string>
<string id="2026" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think of how important it is to find a good place for your trap. A narrow path with overhanging branches is perfect — the beast will tear through the shrubs and will definitely get into the trap.</string>
<string id="2027" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Startling a hare is another good method. It will run into any trap in its terror, no matter how roughly you may make it.</string>
<string id="2028" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You recollect a lesson taught by a hunter acquaintance — you may never change anything you see. You cannot break any twigs or walk over any tracks. If it's a hazel grove, you cannot make your trap out of pine or birch wood.</string>
<string id="2029" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You examine the trap you've just set and cover it with leaves and dirt. This should make the whole thing more reliable.</string>
<string id="2030" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">It occurs to you that you might want to use some smoke from a fire to make sure no trace of human smell remains anywhere.</string>
<string id="2031" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You check whether the trap you've set is sturdy enough. Any minute defect can be used by the animal to its advantage. It will break the trap and run away, much to your chagrin.</string>
<string id="2032" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You have found a tall and supple tree for your trap — this way the beast or the bird will be hoisted right up, and no forest predator will be able to reach it.</string>
<string id="2033" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">A fat quail would be just right. If you bake it in an open fire, you'll eat it up in no time, crunching the bones away! A hare is fine, too, provided it isn't too stringy. A hungry belly will rejoice at anything!</string>
<string id="2034" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You set your trap muttering a hasty prayer — may the gods hear it and grant you a good haul.</string>
<string id="2035" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You wonder whether there may not be enough bait. However, forest beasts have a keen sense of smell. They can smell anything from a long way off, even crumbs.</string>
<string id="2036" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">The pole that you intended to use for the bait unbends suddenly and slaps you right in the face. The left side of your face feels totally numb.</string>
<string id="2037" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You anticipate how a fat hare will get caught in your trap and it occurs to you that you should test its strength. What if the hare proves too heavy and manages to run away? You should also use a thicker pole.</string>
<string id="2038" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You set your trap right on a path that has fresh animal tracks. You know that during the summer such tracks are usually moist — there can even be water inside them. During the winter they crumble at the lightest touch.</string>
<string id="2039" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You bend, and then straighten up again, trying to estimate whether the beast will see your contraption. As you keep on doing those exercises, you scratch your face as you stick it right into a bush, and, after an irate oath, you decide that the trap is probably not visible to animals.</string>
<string id="2040" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You test the pole's flexibility by bending and unbending it. Willow branches are best — there is so much moisture in them that you could probably tie a knot in the branch.</string>
<string id="2041" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You examine the tracks — the ones at the top are wide, and the ones at the bottom are next to each other. These were obviously left by a hare. However, the tracks are rather old.</string>
<string id="2042" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You bend down to take a closer look at the complex pattern of prints left by birds. They are fine and intricate, just like red embroidered patterns on women's dresses.</string>
<string id="2043" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You try to leave your own footprint on the path out of sheer curiosity. But it turns out very vague and hardly visible at all — the ground here is dense and compact.</string>
<string id="2044" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Hares are cunning beasts! They will never just run away from a hunter — they will leave a veritable labyrinth of tracks. Then you have to make a real effort to track them and to find out where they are hiding.</string>
<string id="2045" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that hunting is all about showing more cunning than the other party. A hare is clever — it winds and doubles its tracks. But the hunter is no fool, either. You need a particular kind of cunning — don't stop as you read the tracks, or the bunny will think that it's found and run as fast as it can. What you need to do is deceive the beast — just lift your feet and put them down again, but don't go anywhere. It will never be the wiser.</string>
<string id="2046" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You slip on a rotten piece of wood and flail your arms around as though you were trying to get airborne. You grab branches with your fingers and arch your back. You have managed to keep your balance, after all, but your fingers are all scratched by the branches.</string>
<string id="2047" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">A sharp pain makes you stop in your tracks. You lift your left leg and rub it with your hands. Your foot has failed to avoid a sharp stone, which injures the sole badly. How are you supposed to keep walking now?</string>
<string id="2048" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You remember a hunter who was following a track in just as foolhardy a manner, claiming the most dangerous thing one might encounter there were a quail. He ended up disappearing in the woods without a trace! Only the forest spirits know what fate befell him.</string>
<string id="2049" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">The strange sounds makes you shiver. Is that an owl hooting? Or an invisible forest spirit flying on wings of the night? You no longer care about tracks, studying the sky anxiously.</string>
<string id="2050" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You startled a magpie, and it has started to chatter loudly. You throw a ball of earth into the bird — if it carries on like this, it will scare all the animals away!</string>
<string id="2051" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">A twig snaps under your foot, breaking the silence. You kick the piece of wood in frustration — it has announced your presence to all the animals around.</string>
<string id="2052" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look at the ground and notice an unusual lump that shines in the soft light. You pick it up — one doesn't find useful items like that every day.</string>
<string id="2053" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">A lizard darts off from underneath your feet. You stomp your foot to catch its tail. But you are too clumsy, and the lizard is too agile. It hides in the rocks, and you realize that you have stomped all over the tracks.</string>
<string id="2054" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You feel something fall under the neck of your garment. A beetle! You feel it flounce and kick in every direction, trying to escape. The way you jump around to shake it out of your clothes resembles an elaborate dance.</string>
<string id="2055" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You take an awkward step and twist your foot. You land on your rear end in surprise, rubbing your sprained ankle. If you carry on like this, you can end up lame!</string>
<string id="2056" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You find a heavy pine cone on the path. Its scales are stuck together by resin, which makes your fingers sticky, but the nuts you find inside are soft and sweet, with a milky taste.</string>
<string id="2057" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Your foot sinks underground, and you barely manage to avoid breaking it. It may be someone's burrow or just a hole in the ground — or, maybe, it was dug by the mischievous spirits of the forest for fun. You shake your fist in the air, menacing no one in particular and everyone in general.</string>
<string id="2058" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You examine the ground — the tracks appear to belong to a bear, the master of the forest. It will learn of your invasion instantly, and then it will keep its eye on you. If you think you're hunting it, you're deluded. He's got you in his sights.</string>
<string id="2059" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">It's fun to look for tracks, but you have to be careful! The mischievous spirits of the forest can deceive everyone, including experienced hunters — they'll leave all sorts of tracks to make you run around in circles, and then you'll get lost in the thicket!</string>
<string id="2060" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">If you come across bear tracks, you won't mistake them for anything — they even resemble human tracks a tiny bit. They are round and have five toes, but each toe ends with a dagger as long as a human palm!</string>
<string id="2061" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You take a closer look at the ground — it seems as though you have noticed boar tracks. They are elongated and split in two, like grains of wheat. But these are rather old.</string>
<string id="2062" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You see marks of sharp claws on trees — a bear must have had real fun marking its territory. Now you have to be vigilant wherever you go.</string>
<string id="2063" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You see that the leaves are trampled, but you cannot discern any tracks. You should examine trees for tracks — you might find a mark on the bark or a tuft of wool on one of the branches.</string>
<string id="2064" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You trip over a protruding branch and fall forward, landing right on your face. Your knees are raw and your forehead is injured. (knockdown)</string>
<string id="2065" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You see something that resembles dog tracks on the ground. What would a dog be doing here? It's a wolf! You remember tales about humans that can turn into wolves — those are a great deal more dangerous to come across than actual wolves.</string>
<string id="2066" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You see old grain-like tracks on the ground. It's a boar! But they are stretched into a single line — the beast must have been in a hurry. Who was following it?</string>
<string id="2067" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You inspect the grass you see. If the grains were eaten tidily, it must have been a bear. Boars chew quickly and sloppily — they eat on the run.</string>
<string id="2068" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You seem to have found wolf tracks. Ah well — a single wolf is no danger in the forest, for it will always try to pass a human by. But if you run into a pack during the winter, you're a goner!</string>
<string id="2069" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">The silence is broken by a sudden crack of a twig. You shiver and stand still. Which forest animal could have broken it? Oh, it was your foot…</string>
<string id="2070" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look out for tracks, musing on which animal is the most dangerous — a bear, or a wounded boar? The battle that plays out in your head always ends the same way — the hunter gets torn to pieces.</string>
<string id="2071" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Bears are more intelligent than many a human being! They mess their tracks up so much you can hardly find them. The hunters said it can also attract a moose with a cry that resembles that of a female moose, and pull fishermen's nets out onto the shore. A most cunning beast indeed!</string>
<string id="2072" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Apart from looking around constantly, you keep smelling the wind. For instance, boar droppings have a sharp unpleasant smell — you'll be able to feel it from the distance of twenty feet.</string>
<string id="2073" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">It's best to avoid meeting an irate boar face to snout. And in the winter they fashion themselves armor out of tree resin — that's when they're at their most furious and hard-sided.</string>
<string id="2074" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You see tracks of large clawed paws, but they suddenly stop as if by magic. What unknown powers could have borne the beast away? Or have the forest spirits tricked you by making you run around in circles? You spit across your shoulder for the mirage to disappear.</string>
<string id="2075" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You see torn-off bark high above your head. "What a giant!" you think to yourself. It's best to avoid a bear like that. Or, perhaps, it wasn't a bear in the first place.</string>
<string id="2076" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You keep your eyes on the ground, taking in the powerful and inapproachable atmosphere of the forest. This is where one's proximity to the spirits of nature is felt the most acutely.</string>
<string id="2077" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Blood drips from your knife as you take a satisfied look at the fruits of your labor — the most important thing here is to bleed the carcass well. That requires delivering a precise strike to the heart or slashing the main blood vessels. That's something you can do very aptly, after all.</string>
<string id="2078" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You straighten wearily, thinking this is exactly what your father had taught you: move the knife across the belly, from the head to the tail, with a steady hand. Then make circles around the neck and the limbs — it's easier to skin the carcass that way. Good job!</string>
<string id="2079" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You're looking at the skinned carcass thinking which part of it to bury in the ground to placate God. Heart will probably be best — it embodies life itself, after all.</string>
<string id="2080" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You are pleased with your work — you didn't waste any time with the carcass. After all, it's imperative that you get to business immediately, as soon as the spark of life leaves the body. Otherwise the meat might go stale.</string>
<string id="2081" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You carefully wipe the knife with a tuft of grass. The knife is your closest ally. If you need to butcher and skin a carcass, you need to choose the sharpest knife you have. A dull one won't make it through the ribs. Nor will it cut tough meat — that of a moose, for instance.</string>
<string id="2082" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You put your knife back in its place and think that sometime you need all your skill to skin an animal. If you need the skin to be whole, you have to be very careful — especially from the side of the snout. You need to touch the skull with the knife very gently, as though you were kissing it, and the eyelids need to be pulled down, lest they get damaged.</string>
<string id="2083" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think you heard a hissing sound when you were cutting the meat. You inspect the carcass carefully — if you pierce the stomach with your knife, the meat may spoil instantly.</string>
<string id="2084" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You stop for a breather, remembering the way they hunted back home. If you went far on your hunt, you wouldn't be able to bring just any beast back. Hunters would use their knives with great skill to separate the meat from the bones so as not to break their backs. They would bring the meat home and bury the bones in the ground.</string>
<string id="2085" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You inspect the butchered carcass with pleasure — you've done well; the bladder is right here, and it's completely undamaged. There are hunters of poor skill who would empty everything into the meat — the guts as well as the bladder.</string>
<string id="2086" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You drop the knife on the ground and inspect your palm, which you have sliced with your knife in haste. It is all covered in blood — yours as well as the animal's, which makes it impossible for you to tell just how big the wound is.</string>
<string id="2087" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You have finished work and were just about to stand up when you noticed a scar on the skin — a bald patch without any fur. You trace out the mark with your finger — it looks as though it had been left by an arrow.</string>
<string id="2088" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You look at your bloodied hands thinking just how cruel this world is to its children — everyone has to eat somebody else to survive. Then you shrug: it's either eat or be eaten, after all. And being eaten is much worse any way you look at it.</string>
<string id="2089" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You weren't very tidy when you were skinning the carcass, since you were trying to accomplish it before the deathly chill sets in. Once the carcass chills, it becomes much harder to skin it.</string>
<string id="2090" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You feel an unpleasant sensation on your face — blood had squirted on it when you were cutting one of the major arteries. Now it has dried up and formed a scab-like patch on your skin.</string>
<string id="2091" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You wipe the sweat from your brow with a bloodied hand, trying to catch your breath. You remember the two traditional ways of skinning a carcass. The skin of a deer's or a moose's carcass is peeled off as a single sheet, but when you skin a hare, you have to roll it up inside out.</string>
<string id="2092" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You rest, recollecting one of the customs of the nomadic tribes that used to roam along the Empire's borders. Even within the Empire you find people who call beef and goat meet black, presuming it to be of low quality. They prefer to slaughter rams and horses for their meals.</string>
<string id="2093" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You wipe your knife thinking of how aptly the steppe dwellers butcher animal carcasses. They don't cut bone — instead, they slice the carcass where its joints are. You slash it a few times and that's that!</string>
<string id="2094" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You barely manage to get up and you wipe your brow. This wasn't one of your better days, and it has taken you longer than usual to take care of the carcass</string>
<string id="2095" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You take a good look at the construction site. You chuckle inside — there was a time when the foundation of any house had to have blood sprinkled over it. The tradition is dying out — besides, the state religion does not condone human sacrifice. But modern builders occasionally slaughter a lamb at the construction site, at any rate. It's safer that way.</string>
<string id="2096" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You remember a folk belief — if a builder harbors ill thoughts against someone, he puts a spell on a stone or a log in the new house. There is no worse curse, and nothing can save the unfortunate.</string>
<string id="2097" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You remember that back in the days of yore they would bury some poor soul alive when they built a palace or a fortress. Right in the foundation. Their spirit was supposed to guard the townsfolk or the owner of the castle from the enemies.</string>
<string id="2098" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think of all the different methods of construction. Back in the day there were houses with earthen walls. All you need to do is to tamp it down as much as you can.</string>
<string id="2099" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You remember what your father always used to say: "There must be a solid foundation under any endeavor." So true. And especially true of buildings.</string>
<string id="2100" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">It occurs to you that building a house is like making a living creature. And the power in your hands matches that of the gods, who grant the gift of life.</string>
<string id="2101" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You examine the ground under your feet — you appear to have made no mistake. It doesn't crumble, and it isn't damp, so the ground waters must be running deep. So you have chosen a safe place, after all.</string>
<string id="2102" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You touch a tree with your hand and think of the old custom that trees for building should be felled in the winter — while the tree sleeps, all of its water is sucked into the ground.</string>
<string id="2103" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You also think that forefathers would never permit anyone to use unlucky trees for construction works — those split in two by lighting, for example, or the ones felled by the wind. Stands to reason — who knows what effect it could have on your house?</string>
<string id="2104" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You examine the construction site and think with satisfaction that you have chosen a good place. Not at a crossroads, not at the site of a fire, and not at a graveyard.</string>
<string id="2105" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You scratch the back of your head wondering whether you may have been too hasty with the construction. After all, back in the olden days they would call in diviners, who would observe the flight of birds or toss some sheep bones around to find the best place for construction.</string>
<string id="2106" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You remember how your grandfather would put coins into the foundation for prosperity. And if you put bread in every corner, the residents will never go hungry in their life.</string>
<string id="2107" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You press your palm against the tree — it seems warm. You think that the larch is the best tree for construction. It is sturdy and durable, and lasts many decades. However, you haven't seen any hereabouts.</string>
<string id="2108" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You wonder what kind of timber you should use for the top of the building. Tastes differ, but your favorite wood comes from aspens. They are easy to chop and resilient to rain; the wood sparkles with gold in the sun and with crimson at sunset.</string>
<string id="2109" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Tell me what you will, but I prefer coniferous trees to their deciduous counterparts, whatever they are. The timber is strong and resistant to moisture. The silver fir, for instance, has a pleasant smell; it also keeps you warm better than any other tree.</string>
<string id="2110" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You shave off a thin layer of wood and examine the shaving. Is it supple enough? Can you tie it into a knot? If it crumbles into dust, the wood is finally mature and dry enough. That is why they also keep timber under canopies — to expose them to the wind that will blow all the moisture out of them.</string>
<string id="2111" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Wood is easier to use in construction, of course. Stone is more trouble, but it keeps warmth inside during the winter and coolness in the summer.</string>
<string id="2112" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Wood makes the habitation smell better; on the other hand, neither fire, nor rain can do anything to stone. Fancy someone try to destroy you when you hide behind stone walls!</string>
<string id="2113" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that you truly shouldn't skimp on construction materials — the thicker the wall, the sturdier and the more reliable it is. And in these troubled times one has to think of protection first.</string>
<string id="2114" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think there will not be enough stone and lumber for building a house with proper framework. What you need is a mixture of clay and hay or dry rush, depending on where you live.</string>
<string id="2115" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think that you are a different person when you're hungry, and it's best not to stand in your way — you could eat a whole moose with his skin right now.</string>
<string id="2116" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You swallow a bite and feel it drop down into the greedy and empty stomach that contracts in anticipation of food.</string>
<string id="2117" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Oh, this is a far cry from my dear mom's cooking. That was no food — that was nectar! The golden juices of the meat would trickle down the chin; the fingers and the face would be covered in grease, and the smell was so powerful you could cut it with a knife and put slices in your mouth.</string>
<string id="2118" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Not the kind of food one dreams of right now. Oh, for a fat chunk of pork, or even a young lamb — fresh from the spit, hot and smoky…</string>
<string id="2119" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">The bite you take in haste gets stuck in your throat and you convulsively try to cough it out and catch a breath. Your body is shaken by coughing spasms. The ill-fated chunk is finally out. You wipe the sweat from your brow.</string>
<string id="2120" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Suddenly there's an itch in your nose and you sneeze. Your full mouth is like a geyser spewing half-chewed food.</string>
<string id="2121" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">There is a wasp buzzing around your lips, attracted by the smell of food. You try to wave the pesky insect away, and it retaliates by biting you in the lip. You find that it isn't that easy to chew when your lip is swallen.</string>
<string id="2122" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">A meal is always a good thing. Still, I hope I won't get stomach cramps like the previous time. All the innards felt like they were being turned inside out, as if the very soul was about to have a rendezvous with the ancestors come morning.</string>
<string id="2123" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You swallow the food greedily. Your teeth grind and tear it. One of your cheeks suddenly gets in between your teeth, which work as grindstones. You jerk your head in sudden pain and are forced to chew with more care, trying to favor the damaged side and avoid having food touch it.</string>
<string id="2124" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">A piece of food gets into one of your teeth, and it feels as if it were struck by lightning. You grab your cheek — the tooth worm must be as hungry as you, devouring your flesh greedily.</string>
<string id="2125" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">Finally you truly understand the wise words of your mother: "Hunger is the best seasoning to any food."</string>
<string id="2126" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You feel a sudden weakness in your body, and a sweat comes onto your brow. "Those were some cramps," you think, hoping fervently that, perhaps, at least this time the illness will pass you by.</string>
<string id="2127" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You hear a loud rumble in your intestines. Well, what can you say? A hungry belly has no ears and heeds no words. The only language one's stomach understands is the language of food.</string>
<string id="2128" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You swallow a bite with satisfaction, without having even chewed it properly, and remember an old saying: the stomach is an ingrate and remembers no good deeds. No point discussing yesterday's dinner with it.</string>
<string id="2129" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You dally for a moment, wary of another stomach cramp. Then you open your mouth wide: whatever jumps into your mouth is good for you!</string>
<string id="2130" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You think it feels a lot better once you have dined, no matter how much you eat. And it feels warmer, too.</string>
<string id="2131" important="3" type="gui/images/message/lore/forest.png">You finish chewing the last bite and think that it's much better this way. You cannot stop that gaping hole in the stomach with anything — all you can do is give it food.</string>

<string id="3218">Wait, what about that magic burm... thing I was looking for?</string>
<string id="3219">Wait, what about that magic bergamot thing I was looking for?</string>
<string id="3220">You happen to find one, bring it here straightaway, heh. But remember that it is a mighty secret. Tell no one!</string>
<string id="3221">And one more, about land works, then tell me...</string>
<string id="3222">I understand. So, when will you teach me about forming the earth?</string>
<string id="3223">Ah. Listen up.&#xA;&#xA;Pits are always good, but you need more. If'n you be wanting to construct something, you first flatten the ground so 'tis straight and not inclining itself to one side. And falling come night.&#xA;&#xA;Or maybe you want to build a mound so your enemies have to climb up to reach you. A shovel is what you need, be it wood or metal.</string>
<string id="3224">Or say you need a fortress wall, not a common one but on a slope. Then a shovel you need. First, take it and flatten the earth but with the incline you seek. Only then may your builder make the said wall on that spot.&#xA;&#xA;Got it?</string>
<string id="3225">Or say you need a fortress wall, not along a flat place. Then a shovel you need to shape first the earth to the incline you seek. Then you build your wall.&#xA;&#xA;Understand?</string>
<string id="3226">I will remember that. Any other wisdom for me?</string>
<string id="3227">I will remember that. Any other wisdom for me?</string>
<string id="3228">Plenty more!&#xA;&#xA;Treat your shovel with care, for it is fragile and prone to breaking should you be too clumsy. Beware of chips and cracks in it, and sharpen it with regularity. A wooden shovel will dig but little before it loses all its usefulness.&#xA;&#xA;Wrap your hands with rags, or gloves, if'n you can. And mayhap wrap the handle with something, to save your hands.&#xA;&#xA;Time is passing, and my words have been many. Go on, now, gods be with you.</string>
<string id="3229">Thank you.</string>
<string id="3230">I'll get going.</string>
<string id="3231">*The grave digger is whispering something, paying you no heed*</string>
<string id="3232">Why are you acting so odd?</string>
<string id="3233">Woe is me, my brew is out, and I cannot make more. Would you bring me some mushrooms instead?</string>
<string id="3234">...mushrooms?</string>
<string id="3235">Yes, mushrooms, with the tiny nubs. Good for chewing. I cannot be soberminded in this place! In trade I'll make you a wonderful grave, not like these with their kneeling poses, but fit for an emperor, you'll see! Full size, with outstretched arms.&#xA;&#xA;So you'll bring me my mushrooms, yes?</string>
<string id="3236">I'm not about to head to the grave anytime soon, but thank you for the offer.</string>
<string id="3237">Perhaps you are not "about to," but as the gods will it.&#xA;&#xA;So will you bring me my mushrooms? I have no strength to stretch out my damned existence on this island any further without them. Mushrooms!</string>
<string id="3238">What is so bad about this island? The sun is shining, the grass is green, the earth is rich. Build a dung hut, or better, a stone one, and live here. Or is there something I'm missing?</string>
<string id="3239">So ignorant! Our sun, Amate the Shining, never ceases to give light, that is truth. She spreads her rays in the sky, feeds the earth and grass beneath.&#xA;&#xA;But this island is cursed. Elsewhere men build houses to stand for centuries. Here, if'n they build, it falls 'ere a short time passes.&#xA;&#xA;And treacherous fog surrounds the land to keep up from sailing away. Thus the gods keep us here.&#xA;&#xA;How about those mushrooms?</string>
<string id="3240">Cool it with the mushrooms for one minute! Why don't buildings stay up for long here?</string>
<string id="3241">As I say, the island is damned. Or is your hearing dull? Houses here do not stand long. Tombs, though, they last for ages. Good to dig them early. Ah, hold, I understand you, I do!&#xA;&#xA;So you want to be buried with a warhorse? No one has done that yet.&#xA;Look, our crooked carpenter, our "shipbuilder," wants to be buried with a gavran, the bastard. But only after his third pitcher...</string>

<string id="3247">I will bring you some mushrooms, Gloom take you. Where do I find them?</string>

<string id="3249">Alright. Here I go.</string>

<string id="3258">Hmm.</string>
<string id="3259">Right. *rolls eyes*&#xA;&#xA;&lt;font:Open Sans Italic:20&gt;And then rose Svefnii&#xA;his mighty legs upon the firmament of Elgverden&#xA;and the firmament did shutter and split&#xA;and many cities and realms of the Lungs were ruined&#xA;for upon the world had come the Reaping&#xA;of the Maiden of the Red Scythe, Johdenandhe</string>

<string id="3261">&lt;font:Open Sans Italic:20&gt;And Sparksvaard became a land of strife and slaughter,&#xA;Bargerelung,&#xA;a land replete with collapse,&#xA;loss,&#xA;separation,&#xA;suffering,&#xA;pain, fear, and death.&#xA;Velent.</string>
<string id="3262">&lt;font:Open Sans Italic:20&gt;Svefnii stretched forth his hand&#xA;and gathered the brightest Sparks from the chiefest of powerful Lungs.&#xA;He gathered the Sparks of thousands of thousands,&#xA;and myriads of myriads.&#xA;So numerous they were, that in Svefnii's hand&#xA;there was not found place for them,&#xA;and they did become stars.&#xA;Jomfru. And behold, Svefnii formed a sword from the sparks of the Lungs,&#xA;and it became a ray of light in the darkness.</string>

<string id="3271">Tales? Don't you bother me! I am a gravedigger. I can dig a grave for you. Not like a common villan one to lay hugging your knees but rather like for the Emperor!&#xA;Full size, arms outstretched.&#xA;&#xA;But in return...</string>

<string id="3305">Oh, Abella, island of dreams! I heard people there spend much on tombs, and so grave diggers prosper. Their shovels ne'er go dull, their hands ne'er tire from the digging, and mushrooms, mushrooms everywhere!</string>

<string id="3324">Good. I will speak with you then.</string>
<string id="3325">Do you have any work for me?</string>
<string id="3326">Right timely, ye are. I be in want of some assistance with fishing.&#xA;&#xA;People keep on coming our way. I reckon this a benefit, for many hands make light work, if I say so. Nary a man here be not in need of nourishment.&#xA;&#xA;As ye are no doubt awares, I hunt and fish for scran, but I only maintain mah pace with difficulty. Your help catching fish would be most welcome.&#xA;&#xA;Ye shall require a proper fishing rod.</string>
<string id="3327">Where can I find said fishing rod?</string>
<string id="3328">A wooden branch shall be dandy for the greater part of it.&#xA;Seek ye one out in the forest. Forests grow trees, trees grow branches, and so forests have branches.&#xA;&#xA;We weave rope of Plant Fibers in this realm.&#xA;Find some and weave it and fix it to the branch.&#xA;&#xA;Believe it or not, in this world we also catch fish in water. Once ye have a fishing rod in hand, go to the shore to begin catching.</string>
<string id="3329">Understood.</string>
<string id="3330">Ye have any questions?</string>
<string id="3331">I have a question about catching fish.</string>
<string id="3332">Fish are caught with a fishing rod. Fried on a fire it is really yummy. Once ye have made a rod, find your way to the shore. All ye catch there, be it a wee fish or a whole school, shall be eaten, I assure ye!</string>

<string id="3335">I understand.</string>
<string id="3336">I understand.</string>
<string id="3337">I have heard it said you possess secret knowledge. That you are able to kindle a fire. Might you teach me?</string>
<string id="3338">A fire? Aye, and what be so hard about that? The more firewood, the longer it does burn. Most useful to cook fish or other meat along the way.</string>
<string id="3339">I have some fish for you.</string>
<string id="3340">I have some fish for you.</string>
<string id="3341">Ach, bonnie lad, a sight to behold! Give it here.</string>
<string id="3342">Ach, bonnie lass, a sight to behold! Give it here.</string>
<string id="3343">Here you go.</string>
<string id="3344">Farewell.</string>
<string id="3345">Ah, ye are here yet.</string>
<string id="3346">Since I am, have you more work for me?</string>
<string id="3347">Certainly! Aid with mah hunting I require.&#xA;&#xA;Ye recall that many come hither, a great multitude, all looking to stuff their faces. Our cook prepares scran for them. Do ye ken her, the beauty aye toiling by the cauldron?&#xA;&#xA;Me being a hunter, I pursue fish and beast, but the need has outgrown mah capacity.&#xA;&#xA;Assist me with the wild game. For this, ye will need a weapon, be it ax or sling.</string>
<string id="3348">How might I acquire this weapon I need?</string>
<string id="3349">This is great wisdom. Well done for asking.&#xA;&#xA;Here, take this sling. With proper skill, the weapon is formidable. Whoever takes a slingshot to the head will not be laughing! Gather some stones lying around for the sling.&#xA;&#xA; Find a boar or something to kill in the woods - but don't go far without a knife.&#xA;&#xA;Get the meat and bring it here.</string>

<string id="3351">Have ye any questions?</string>
<string id="3352">I have a question regarding hunting.</string>
<string id="3353">Hunting brings scran, and scran brings strength and vitality. A good hunt means lots of meat, and eating lots of meat restores your strength for an even better hunt the next time!&#xA;Now do ye understand mah wisdom?&#xA;&#xA;But a beast is not only meat, for it also possesses hide, bones, horns, tusks... All of these things are most essential. Life without animal skin is impossible, for leather is made from it. Tusks are the makers of superior bows. And bird feathers, as they help the creatures fly – nary an arrow of ours takes flight but with their feathers&#xA;&#xA;Make your way to the forest and track a beast. Aim your face towards the earth and find animal tracks, then follow in them until the beast is in your sight. Then will dawn the moment of truth, and either ye shall kill the beast, or... as the gods do will it.</string>
<string id="3354">What beasts inhabit the forest? Which are best to hunt?</string>
<string id="3355">As in every place, moose and wild bull, deer and ram, hare and partridge. Wild horses, too. The odd bear, the wolf pack here and there. Ah yes, and the boar.&#xA;&#xA;Yet take nary a moment to seek dragons here, for they be naught.</string>
<string id="3356">Which is the most dangerous?</string>
<string id="3357">Ye ken it not? The wolf, the bear, and the boar are perilous. Watch that ye be not careless with them. As soon as they hear ye, they shall cast themselves upon ye, intending to devour ye whole.&#xA;&#xA;The moose, the bull, the sheep and ram, and the wild horse are a different matter. They shall attempt to flee. But if driven to despair, they may attack to save their lives.&#xA;&#xA;The hares and partridges, though, are naught but peaceful and shall never harm ye.&#xA;&#xA;That is it.</string>
<string id="3358">What about a weapon? How shall I acquire one?</string>
<string id="3359">I have some meat for you.</string>
<string id="3360">I have some meat for you.</string>

<string id="3366">Step by step.</string>
<string id="3367">Might you grant me some fireleaf for our time together?</string>
<string id="3368">Ach, ye wallaper, how dare... ah, it's ye, lad. I shall treat ye to some. Need ye aught besides fireleaf?</string>

<string id="3371">Let us hear it.</string>
<string id="3372">What is that tower of ships you have?</string>
<string id="3373">Might I advise ye to maintain sobriety and avoid swally, and towers of vessels shall trouble ye no more.</string>
<string id="3374">Why are so many people hanging here?</string>
<string id="3375">It used to be empty and boring, hard to find the path to the village without them. But now ye can aye find it, even at night! Such a happy sight to see when ye seek the way home. And a happy sound, a guiding sound, the way their ropes creak.</string>
<string id="3376">I see you are building a ship...</string>

<string id="3419">Hey, square job ye did! Gimme them.&#xA;&#xA;Cut yer fingers off? No? Now ye train an' try to make all sorts o' items. Any questions, come ask.</string>
<string id="3420">Well, thank you for the lesson!</string>
<string id="3421">Might you grant me some fireleaf during our time together?</string>
<string id="3422">Ay, I'm generous today. Let's 'ave a smoke!</string>
<string id="3423">What is this tower of ships I see before me?</string>
<string id="3424">What tower? Where? I not build any tower, no sir. I build a dive an' dip.&#xA;&#xA;Where'd yer tower come from? Hit yer 'ead somewhere? Go get a khtynka from our cook to get rid o' those harmful thoughts. Good strong stuff straight fra' the steppes.</string>
<string id="3425">Who are all those people hanging there?</string>
<string id="3426">Not hang, sacrifice for the gods. Gods pleased, they let us free. But no, this is no freedom. This place is no better than a horse's ass. We want freedom. We want Abella, a good place, a happy one.&#xA;&#xA;But the gods, 'em needs more sacrifices.</string>
<string id="3427">What are you building here?</string>
<string id="3428">Ah, this 'ere be the Baked Bean o' the Sea!</string>
<string id="3429">Wow! Uh, what is that?</string>
<string id="3430">Tis a dive and dip! For sailin' far. Sailin' to Abella!</string>
<string id="3431">A dive and dip? Oh, a ship. Right. I thought it was just a heap of trash.</string>
<string id="3432">A dive and dip? Oh, a ship. Right. I thought it was just a heap of trash.</string>
<string id="3433">You a shipmaster, then?</string>
<string id="3434">No, no, just that such ships do not exist, I swear by Sófaþek.</string>
<string id="3435">Wot ye goin' on about? Insultin' me! I been lookin' at scrolls from our Accur, an' this looks jus' like them things in 'is scrolls. An' I swear it by Khoohalday! Ye know what the wisdom o' dive-n-dipmaking is?</string>
<string id="3436">Uh, what?</string>
<string id="3437">Whatever ye name it, that's 'ow it swim, so say Erthnii, or Kharanhoo.&#xA;&#xA;So I call it by a simple, melodious name: "Hon Hayrata-tan Khere Tangys Essaer Garuy Kharanhoo a Ver."&#xA;&#xA;Which in our native tongue is, "Raven hunter warrior sail o'er the bloody sea 'neath Kharanhoo's cloak, fly to the West."&#xA;&#xA;Yeah, that sound like a right proper name!&#xA;&#xA;But everyone is callin' it "Gavranhavfen," or jus' a "Gavran." An' the gravedigger calls it "the tub." Daft kht'yn, probably jus' gettin' all vines an' trellis.</string>
<string id="3438">So why build a ship? You are a Khoor! You live on steppes and wilderness and speak your rhymes and songs, not travel the seas.</string>
<string id="3439">For that is the will of our gods! An' the elder. That'll be all I say to that.</string>
<string id="3440">Tell me about Abella</string>
<string id="3441">Abella is a fine place! I want t' go there, very much.&#xA;&#xA;Steppes stretchin' out t' the horizon, farther than a man can ride in a lifetime. An' grass as tall as a man. Fat herds, sky heavy wif rain, but Amate's rays always shinin'. And Abella's rivers as deep as the 'eavens!</string>
<string id="3442">I need to go. Worldly affairs and all.</string>
<string id="3443">Tell me about the Baked Bean o' the Sea again.</string>
<string id="3444">Why ain't ye listen the last time?&#xA;&#xA;Whatever ye name it, that's 'ow it swim, so say Erthnii, or Kharanhoo.&#xA;&#xA;So I call it by a simple, melodious name: "Hon Hayrata-tan Khere Tangys Essaer Garuy Kharanhoo a Ver."&#xA;&#xA;Which in our native tongue is, "Raven hunter warrior sail o'er the bloody sea 'neath Kharanhoo's cloak, fly to the West."&#xA;&#xA;Yeah, that sound like a right proper name!&#xA;&#xA;But everyone is callin' it "Gavranhavfen," or jus' a "Gavran."&#xA;An' our gravedigger calls it "the tub." Daft kht'yn, probably jus' gettin' all vines an' trellis.</string>
<string id="3445">Ah, another one...</string>
<string id="3446">Asoveh Svefnii!</string>
<string id="3447">Asoveh. What might I do for you?</string>
<string id="3448">I have been cast by the waves onto the shores of this wilderness. Thus I seek the elder. Are you he?</string>
<string id="3449">I am. I am called Solev the Listener, and I am the elder here.&#xA;Yes? *listens* I hear your will.&#xA;&#xA;Now tell me, son, why you are here, and who you are. From whence have the gods brought you? Hold nothing back, for the gods see all, tell all...&#xA;&#xA;I must know all about you. And so must the gods.&#xA;Speak, for I listen, and determine what sort of vegetable you be.</string>
<string id="3450">I am. I am called Solev the Listener, and I am the elder here.&#xA;Yes? *listens* I hear your will.&#xA;&#xA;Now tell me, daughter, why you are here, and who you are. From whence have the gods brought you? Hold nothing back, for the gods see all, tell all...&#xA;&#xA;I must know all about you. And so must the gods.&#xA;Speak, for I listen, and determine what sort of vegetable you be.</string>
<string id="3451">Vegetable? We are humans, or are you not aware?</string>
<string id="3452">So I see, two arms, two legs, even a head on your shoulders.&#xA;And yet I see no seal, no mark.&#xA;Which of the gods do you follow?</string>
<string id="3453">So I see, two arms, two legs, even a head on your shoulders.&#xA;And yet I see no seal, no mark.&#xA;Which of the gods do you follow?</string>
<string id="3454">Svefnii, the Sleeper. May he never wake.</string>
<string id="3455">May he never wake, may his sleep be eternal, may he reside in the cold darkness. Yes? *listens to the gods*</string>
<string id="3456">I say so. And I was cast upon your shores by the waves.</string>
<string id="3457">Thus it is.</string>
<string id="3458">Who I am, who I was, I remember nothing more of that.</string>
<string id="3459">Who I am, who I was, I remember nothing more of that.</string>
<string id="3460">That, I believe. Yes? *listens*</string>
<string id="3461">I only recall that I dreamed of arriving at Abella.</string>
<string id="3462">I only recall that I dreamed of arriving at Abella.</string>
<string id="3463">Yes, yes.&#xA;&#xA;Does this all seem strange to you? Indeed, when I first came to these shores, I was likewise astonished. Be not astounded, nor hold unneeded thoughts in your mind, or you will become like our Gravedigger.&#xA;&#xA;We are all here in the will of the gods, as are all! Yes?&#xA;&#xA;Indeed, indeed.&#xA;</string>
<string id="3464">Nobody in these parts wants to talk to me. Say I might be Gloomdung.</string>
<string id="3465">Indeed, they are right to not wish to. The waves bring all sorts to our cursed shores. Perhaps you are human, or mayhap you are but a pretender. Or even a bastard heretic. For so some prove themselves to be. Yes, yes.&#xA;&#xA;We always have a free rope for such invaders. Yes? *listening* Yes, and a sharp stake, of course.&#xA;&#xA;Bear no ill will towards the people of this village. They have endured much. Now, they shall speak with you.</string>
<string id="3466">Thank you. Farewell.</string>
<string id="3467">Wait. Here is the secret prayer, which can return you to your home from any place. Yes? Yes, yes.&#xA;&#xA;Then, do not run away far. Bind a place in the house and come back to me.</string>
<string id="3468">Once again, thank you. Asvedeh, Elder.</string>
<string id="3469">*When he sees you, the elder cocks his head, listening from his left ear*</string>
<string id="3470">Shall I share some fireleaf with you, Elder?</string>
<string id="3471">Why should it not be so? Share, as you are so generous. You come bearing a question, I see. Speak it.</string>
<string id="3472">Why should it not be so? Share, as you are so generous. You come bearing a question, I see. Speak it.</string>
<string id="3473">Of a surety, I do. Why have you covered the field with idols?</string>
<string id="3474">Idols? Idols... Yes, that I may answer. For the gods. Those, who were before us placed them, and so we, too, have placed them here.&#xA;&#xA;For we must appease the gods, so that they shall better hear us and shall release hence. Hitherto, however, their will has been... no!</string>
<string id="3475">Have you trouble hearing, Elder? You often ask me to repeat myself.</string>
<string id="3476">Me? Trouble hearing? No. I...&#xA;&#xA;Hmm, why are you here? Go! I must speak with the gods. They... they require an offering, and offering...</string>
<string id="3477">Uh, yes, I'll be going...</string>
<string id="3478">What is this tower of ships I see before me?</string>
<string id="3479">I knew you were the chosen of the gods! No, I see nothing. I am but an ordinary man, and thus I may live awhile more.</string>
<string id="3480">I knew you were the chosen of the gods! No, I see nothing. I am but an ordinary man, and thus I may live awhile more.</string>
<string id="3481">Why are so many hanging here?</string>
<string id="3482">So you have taken notice. Observant. The gods value that trait. What's that? Yes, yes.&#xA;Those hanging here are those we have come to call the heretics.&#xA;Those of the mysterious Holza's fog, who came to this island seeking to do only Svefnii knows what to us all.</string>

<string id="3484">Only Svefnii knows what?</string>
<string id="3485">They named our gods "enemies of the human race" and called for our idols to be smashed and burned. They would not recognize our god, Svefnii. And so, we...&#xA;We hung them out to dry in the fiery eyes of Amate, that their evil thoughts may be erased, and so they became pleasing to the gods.&#xA;&#xA;Among their number were found some warrior priests skilled with weaponry, and so we had to erect walls around the village. But that was all in the past, and the present demands that we act for the glory of the gods and for our salvation.&#xA;&#xA;One of the deeds so required was sacrifice... What's that?</string>
<string id="3486">The hammer of Svefnii. I hear it! Its roar calls me...</string>
<string id="3487">I see you are building a ship...</string>
<string id="3488">Indeed we are. And its completion does require a bloody sacrifice!</string>
<string id="3489">Tell me what this place is.</string>
<string id="3490">It is called the Village. *listens* What's that?</string>
<string id="3491">Just "the village"?</string>
<string id="3492">Dare not to laugh, dear one. Yes, "the Village."&#xA;&#xA;We have named our village many times, but those names no one can now recall, for the gods do not will it.&#xA;&#xA;The Village is located on an island named Idirverden. Some, however, call it Illa-sogskelle, and others call it – or called it, rather – "Purgatory," mean that whatever it will. &#xA;&#xA;Our grave digger, however, has quite a simple name for it when he's drunk. And then our carpenter call it by those funny rhymes of his.</string>
<string id="3493">I see.</string>
<string id="3494">Please tell me where I can find...</string>
<string id="3495">the Hunter</string>
<string id="3496">That is known. The Hunter is always along the shore, under the trees there.</string>
<string id="3497">the Accur</string>
<string id="3498">That is known. Our Accur is always by the bell.</string>
<string id="3499">the Blacksmith</string>
<string id="3500">In the blacksmith's shop of course. Where else?</string>
<string id="3501">the Carpenter</string>
<string id="3502">Search for him by the ship, for it is there that he labors.</string>

<string id="3510">O Abella, magical island where wishes are granted! A place of peace and order, a place where elders are respected. Yes, yes... the gods are there respected as well, and receive abundant offerings from the people. And fireleaf there is never stolen!</string>

<string id="3540">Teach me how to make food, too.</string>
<string id="3541">Ye go an' 'unt a beast, or grab some eggs from the 'enhouse, an' don't ye eat 'em right away, ye go an' bring 'em 'ere. Or start a fire right in the forest an' cook 'em that way. Ye can ask the Hunter about the fire, but it be simple. Take sticks, add fire.&#xA;&#xA;If ye find no game an' the chickens ain't laid, catch some bugs from out under yer feet, or pull up some roots. Roots, now they ain't 'alf bad.&#xA;Ye can also pick apples, berries, or mushrooms.</string>
<string id="3542">What need have we of this kitchen when we may cook fish and meat over the fire?</string>
<string id="3543">Ye cannot make true good, abundant food o'er a fire out in the woods. We not talk 'bout no roots an' berries now.&#xA;&#xA;To really fill up yer belly, needin' no more fer three days, findin' naught but success, yer food must be smartly cooked wif many prepared ingredients. Like my food. So ye need to cook this food in the kitchen.</string>
<string id="3544">Where do I get these ingredients?</string>
<string id="3545">As I say, many ways. Count 'em:&#xA;Huntin'. Fishin'. Growin' fruits an' vegetables. 'Shrooms and berries from the forest, an' wild apples.&#xA;&#xA;Pick whiche'er ye like.</string>

She fears rustles in the night. She fears the cries of owls. 'Tis funny.&#xA;&#xA;Just yesterdayI heard the wolves hear howling. Also funny!&#xA;Do you know hunger? We do. We know it well. And so do the wolves, and the mosquitoes. Are they biting?</string>
<string id="3618">What, then? Can you not see? We are the frightened children, unable to care for ourselves, nowhere to hide from the foul weather, from the night horrors – and any man or beast we meet could send us to the grave.&#xA;&#xA;But if you are truly ready, you can help us. You can save us.</string>

You can save us.</string>
<string id="3620">I do not understand. You wish me to take you to the village, to your mother?</string>
<string id="3621">No! We cannot enter the village! The blacksmith once banished us. Mad, he wanted to kill us all!</string>
<string id="3622">Do you need some kind of help?</string>
<string id="3623">*Lodur pops his eyes and sticks out his tongue*</string>
<string id="3624">Build us a shelter! Or we will all... die here.&#xA;Look...</string>
<string id="3625">Gods be good! Where did you acquire gold?</string>
<string id="3626">We have more. Lots more. How about it?</string>
<string id="3627">I have heard tell that structures here do not last long.</string>
<string id="3628">I have heard tell that structures here do not last long.</string>
<string id="3629">We only need it for a short time. Can you do it?</string>
<string id="3630">Yes. You shall have your shelter.</string>
<string id="3631">No one ever sails away from here. But you are a different matter altogether. Though...&#xA;&#xA;How is our shelter going?</string>
<string id="3632">Not ready yet. Soon.</string>
<string id="3633">No need to hurry. Mara's not about to freeze to death or anything.</string>
<string id="3634">It is done.</string>
<string id="3635">Hah, you did it!</string>
<string id="3636">Hah, you did it!</string>
<string id="3637">Where is my reward?</string>
<string id="3638">Your real reward is Abella. You may go there now.</string>
<string id="3639">How do I get there?</string>
<string id="3640">The boat man will take you. Mara asked him to, but you'll still need to give him payment.</string>
<string id="3641">The boat man will take you. Mara asked him to, but you'll still need to give him payment.</string>
<string id="3642">Who is this boatman?</string>
<string id="3643">What do you care? He'll take you. For payment. One way only.</string>
<string id="3644">Alright.</string>
<string id="3645">*Lodur gazes at you thoughtfully*</string>
<string id="3646">Is Mara your sister?</string>
<string id="3647">Aye. She is stupid, and always cold. The blacksmith nigh killed her when we desired to live with them all.</string>
<string id="3648">Blacksmiths do not, as a rule, kill children.</string>
<string id="3649">He is mad, I say. But no matter.&#xA;&#xA;Mara has a scythe, and we will kill him ourselves later. Then I will play A Spark Goes Out over his corpse, haha!</string>
<string id="3650">Strange boy.</string>
<string id="3651">*Mara gazes at the heavens, taking no notice of you*</string>
<string id="3652">There you are.</string>
<string id="3653">There you are! We were waiting for you. This place is not exactly warm.</string>
<string id="3654">What are you doing out here alone? Your mother is looking for you.</string>
<string id="3655">We're playing! And we're not alone... by the way, we have a job for you. Did Lodur tell you already? Go ask him!</string>
<string id="3656">How about instead I take you back to the village, to your mother?</string>
<string id="3657">You don't know our mother. And you definitely can't take us to her!&#xA;&#xA;We're allowed to play anywhere on the island. Or even with the island. Or with you. Or with the elder. With anyone and anywhere we want!</string>
<string id="3658">Goodbye, child.</string>
<string id="3659">Did you help Lodur?</string>
<string id="3660">Did you help Lodur?</string>
<string id="3661">Not yet.</string>
<string id="3662">Why?</string>
<string id="3663">I built you a hut.</string>
<string id="3664">I built you a hut.</string>
<string id="3665">You did it!</string>
<string id="3666">You did it!</string>
<string id="3667">And my reward?</string>
<string id="3668">Your real reward is Abella. You may go there now.</string>
<string id="3669">That's your reward. We've chosen you.</string>
<string id="3670">*Mara gazes through you*</string>
<string id="3671">Is Lodur your brother?</string>
<string id="3672">No, but you should help him.</string>
<string id="3673">No, but you should help him.</string>
<string id="3674">*Assel sizes you up*</string>
<string id="3675">Asoveh Svefnii!</string>
<string id="3676">Asveh. What do you need?</string>
<string id="3677">Well, I...</string>
<string id="3678">Wait. First go talk to the elder. He is our leader.&#xA;He will examine you, determine whether you are a good person or Gloomdung. Shall he grant you his blessing to be here, I will talk with you.&#xA;&#xA;You shall find the elder in the long building nearby.</string>
<string id="3679">We have already spoken.</string>
<string id="3680">Have you spoken with the elder?</string>
<string id="3681">Have you spoken with the elder?</string>
<string id="3682">Then go.&#xA;&#xA;He is our leader and shall examine and consider you. Shall he decide you are fit to be here, return to me.</string>
<string id="3683">Then go.&#xA;&#xA;He is our leader and shall examine and consider you. Shall he decide you are fit to be here, return to me.</string>

<string id="3685">It is good that you have spoken.&#xA;Now I shall talk with you. And I do love to talk.</string>
<string id="3686">I have a practical question.</string>
<string id="3687">You may ask it later.&#xA;&#xA;First, you must clean the chicken coop, for that will please the gods!&#xA;The coop's cages are full of droppings, and the birds perish before they even reach the kitchen cauldron, ceasing to produce eggs to sustain me for the glory of the gods.&#xA;&#xA;Therefore hearken to this quest:&#xA;You must clean the chicken coop in the village and collect the eggs. The chickens must not perish from the dung and so you must complete the cleaning before more hatch.&#xA;&#xA;Proceed!</string>

<string id="3689">I understand. It shall be done!</string>
<string id="3690">Understood. It shall be done!</string>
<string id="3691">You have returned with haste. Have you cleaned the coops?</string>
<string id="3692">You have returned with haste. Have you cleaned the coops?</string>
<string id="3693">I have cleaned all the droppings that I found.</string>
<string id="3694">I have cleaned all the droppings that I found.</string>
<string id="3695">And have you brought this old man some eggs?</string>
<string id="3696">And have you brought this old man some eggs?</string>
<string id="3697">Here is one egg for you.</string>
<string id="3698">One? What?</string>
<string id="3699">That is all they laid...</string>
<string id="3700">My child, the time has come for me to plant yet another grain of wisdom into your unreasoned mind.&#xA;&#xA;Since ancient times there have existed invisible spiritual laws, laws not established by us. Every decent person must respect such laws or receive all sorts of terrible troubles upon their head.&#xA;&#xA;Liars and perjurers, deceivers and murderers, robbers and other harmers of men and women violate these invisible laws.&#xA;&#xA;So why do you, dear one, attempt to cheat this humble servant of the gods? For this your unforgivable act, you shall receive inescapable and terrible punishment.</string>
<string id="3701">The judgment for your transgression shall be deadly. In any settlement, however, you must be first judged by the laws of men, not yet the laws of the gods.&#xA;&#xA;Therefore I shall bring you to the elder and tell him all, and they shall stone you and hang you.</string>
<string id="3702">Stop! Gloom got to me! Forgive me and I shall give you the eggs.</string>
<string id="3703">That is not sufficient.&#xA;&#xA;But let it be so. I shall give you the rare opportunity to restore your name.&#xA;&#xA;Approach the idol, fall prostrate before him, and cry out to the Sleeper and to the other gods until your conscience clears.&#xA;&#xA;And give me back those eggs.</string>
<string id="3704">I understand. I will do as you say.</string>
<string id="3705">I understand. I will do as you say.</string>
<string id="3706">Tell me, O wise one, what is happening here?</string>
<string id="3707">Share some fireleaf with me, and I shall.</string>
<string id="3708">Of course I will share.</string>
<string id="3709">Then I am listening.</string>
<string id="3710">What is that tower of ships you have?</string>
<string id="3711">We do all for the will of our gods! They see all, know all, watch all, and direct us all.</string>
<string id="3712">And why are all those people hanging?</string>
<string id="3713">They are heretics and degenerates, and as such they are hung to dry before the eyes of Amate! Monsters who brought in themselves evil unto this island, marked for judgment by the gods. We and the elder found them out in good time, and so we made our pleasing offering to Amate, presenting them before her eyes.</string>
<string id="3714">I see you are building a ship...</string>
<string id="3715">Indeed! We must set sell from this island to that of Abella as soon as the gods so bless us.</string>
<string id="3716">Well, Father, I shall take my leave.</string>
<string id="3717">I don't have any.</string>
<string id="3718">I shall go now.</string>
<string id="3719">I shall go now.</string>
<string id="3720">What is your question for me?</string>
<string id="3721">I was struck by a wooden plank recently. To whom shall I go?</string>
<string id="3722">You are right to consult with me, for I work much with wood.&#xA;&#xA;And therefore I say to you that first of all, you must please the gods. You shall need an ax and a saw.&#xA;&#xA;You may take this ax, but you shall not lose it or dull its edge! You will ask the saw at our shipbuilder Yermyk.&#xA;&#xA;Take it into the forest, select a suitable tree, and bring it down. When you cut down, drag the log exactly to the idol. Then go to the field. Make your cries to the Sleeper,or to whomever you pray there, place the idol in the earth.&#xA;&#xA;The field of idols is located outside of the village, to the north.</string>

<string id="3725">I do not understand, alas. Please explain it to me again.</string>
<string id="3726">Then hearken to me yet again.&#xA;&#xA;Select the place you intend to raise the idol. Place your construction area for it on the ground, and a sign will appear. Be not afraid of this magic, for it is by the will of the gods.&#xA;&#xA;Then, cut down a tree. Your saw shall turn the tree into a log. Place this log into your unfinished construction area marked by the sign, and it is finished.&#xA;&#xA;Just be sure you know to whom this idol shall be ahead of time.</string>
<string id="3727">I have placed the idol.</string>
<string id="3728">I have placed the idol.</string>
<string id="3729">Worthy of commendation. A young man is always better off when god-fearing and obedient. Yet instead of this empty praise, here – receive from me this gift.</string>
<string id="3730">Worthy of commendation. A young woman is always better off when god-fearing and obedient. Yet instead of this empty praise, here – receive from me this gift.</string>
<string id="3731">Thank you for your generosity.</string>
<string id="3732">Indeed.</string>
<string id="3733">*Assell gazes at you with a drunken stare*</string>
<string id="3734">Tell me about our world...</string>
<string id="3735">Our world since ancient times has been called Sparksvaard.&#xA;&#xA;And it grows like an apple on a branch of the great World Tree. But it is not alone, for it sits among the worlds of our gods. As we mortal humans build ourselves houses, so the gods did in ancient days resolve that they needed worlds of their own.&#xA;&#xA;And they made it so.</string>
<string id="3736">Do you say so?</string>
<string id="3737">Since that time, Svefnii the Sleeper has resided in the fiery forges of Risterverden, chained to the World Tree by his own kin.&#xA;&#xA;Gloom the Horny wanders his halls in Izenlen.&#xA;&#xA;Holza, Kallente, Amate, and Velent are neighbors to Gloom in Izenlen, where their halls likewise reside, and Gloom "drops by" at times, of course, hee hee.</string>
<string id="3738">I do not blame him.</string>
<string id="3739">You don't say!</string>
<string id="3740">Hold on, listen still!&#xA;&#xA;Terskel the One-Armed, along with his ice army, keeps eternal vigil on the walls of Terrskellen, built around the flaming Risterverden.&#xA;&#xA;Johdenandhe and Jomfrutotte share the frozen plains of Smertverden. But the younger sister, Jomfru, expends more of her time in our world...</string>
<string id="3741">Sófaþek-king, bringing all to exhaustion by his wisdom, was banished by the maidens of Day and Night from Izenlen, and now resides on its threshold, pestering all who pass by with questions that have no answers, and generously sharing his weighty wisdom.&#xA;&#xA;Indeed, his wisdom is so heavy that any who receives but a tiny portion of it falls forthwith to Johde and Smertverden...&#xA;&#xA;This was revealed to me after few good swallows of khtynka.</string>
<string id="3742">Tell me of our gods.</string>
<string id="3743">Of which of them do you wish to hear?</string>
<string id="3744">Of all of them, but in summary</string>
<string id="3745">Both old and young know of our gods. Rarely do such as you creep onto our shores... well, fair enough. Hear then the legends of old.&#xA;&#xA;Our world is ruled by cunning, spiteful gods, among them the sun Amate, the hurried Velent Night, the trickster Gloom, and mistress of time Holza the Spinstress, and the sisters Jomfru and Johde, mistresses of our deaths. The beauty Kallente, helper of all the earth, is among them, as well, along with the craftsman Aori and the wiseman Sófaþek-king.&#xA;&#xA;It is noted that these gods exercise active influence. Furthermore, our greatest god is bewitched, imprisoned in the depths of the world, and he is called Svefnii by the Slavards, or commonly the Sleeper. May he sleep soundly forever, and may his wrath pass from us.&#xA;&#xA;So there you are. Relations between mortals and the gods are maintained by the lowly Accurs, including myself. Turn to me if you need anything in this regard.&#xA;&#xA;If you feel you have offended the gods, come to me with all haste, and bring a worthy sacrifice. I, as it is written, shall... pass it on.</string>
<string id="3746">Svefnii the Sleeper</string>
<string id="3747">Hear me, then.&#xA;&#xA;The highest of the gods of our world is the Sleeper.&#xA;The Slavards call him Svefnibrann, which being interpreted is the Sleeping Fire. Or, just Svefnii, the Sleeper. Called Akneh-Hootga or Akneh by the Khoors, but we, the Gottlungs, possess the true knowledge and therefore call him the Sleeper.&#xA;&#xA;Other names for him include the Hammerer, the Napping One and the Slumberer, the Hammerheaded, the Treeshaker, the Master, and the Hammer Master. Some blasphemers dare call him the Snorer, but for that they shall doubtless pay, for the Sleeper's wrath and vengeance is terrible indeed.</string>
<string id="3748">Huh. Yes.</string>
<string id="3749">Stern is the Sleeper, most severe!&#xA;&#xA;He slumbers now in the depths of our world, his unquenchable fury smoldering within him. He must not awaken from that sleep, or he shall rise to his full immensity and rend the earth, filling it with fire! Then Svefnii shall strike down the World Tree, destroying both worlds and heavens, and time itself shall cease.&#xA;&#xA;And the last battle shall come, where all the gods shall fall before the wrath of Svefnii in Godernblodbad!</string>
<string id="3750">Gordebod... Gordonblee... what is it? It sounds terrible!</string>
<string id="3751">GODERNBLODBAD!&#xA;&#xA;It is the Godmassacre, the final battle, wherein the Sleeper, so the scriptures say, shall ruin all of the gods, and the worlds shall be reduced to dust and engulfed in flame!&#xA;&#xA;And mortals shall burn as fuel for his furnace.</string>
<string id="3752">I am sorry I asked, and my brow sweats from the mere prospect!</string>
<string id="3753">I am sorry I asked, and my brow sweats from the mere prospect!</string>
<string id="3754">Be not overly much occupied by fear.&#xA;&#xA;For to prevent the Sleeper from awakening, we, the Accurs, are here in the world, as it is written. The sweat on our brows runs red from the toil of our labor in unceasing rituals. We strengthen the earth with all of our might!&#xA;&#xA;For this strengthening and this labor... meals of meat and eggs really are best, on a daily basis, if possible.&#xA;&#xA;And it is advisable to wash it down with khtynka, for a certainty.</string>
<string id="3755">And what if... what if I make it myself?</string>
<string id="3756">Make an offering?&#xA;&#xA;You require true understanding for that!&#xA;&#xA;If you wish to offer khtynka or fresh meat, bring it hither to me.&#xA;I may... speed your sacrifice on its way through the earth, to the underworld.&#xA;&#xA;On your own, it shall be very hard, very hard labour indeed. The Sleeper requires the sacrifice of blood and sweet from ordinary mortals, so the scriptures say.&#xA;&#xA;Should you cultivate the land or raise a building, the sweat of your brow is your sacrifice. And should you fight a battle, your offering is the blood you shed.</string>
<string id="3757">Thank you for teaching me.</string>
<string id="3758">Aori Goldenhanded</string>
<string id="3759">Aori is the Master, who at the command of the ancient gods created the silver braces of our world of Sparksvaard and made sure the heavenly dome dividing the worlds of Elgverden from the universe outside, the world of the Creator. He was defeated in the Godmassacre and disappeared into the Outer Light.&#xA;&#xA;We do not pray to him, as a rule, and yet if you have a great desire, you may bring me a boar, and I shall express your wishes to him, as it is written.</string>
<string id="3760">Gloom the Jester</string>
<string id="3761">Call also the Jester, the Slacker, the Aspid, the Horny One, the Thief, and called Khoohalday by the Khoors.&#xA;&#xA;He received none of the inner flame, when the Ereborns blinded him. But Svefnii himself gave a piece of this flame to Gloom, torn from his very self, as it is written.&#xA;&#xA;Gloom is crafty and cunning! It was he who persuaded his sister, Alglemy, to lie with Svefnii the Sleeper and to implant in him the idea of mutiny against the Ereborns. And Svefnii the Sleeper lay with her indeed.</string>
<string id="3762">So the...</string>
<string id="3763">This living sword, Gloom stole from the Wisest Ones. It is called Vallum Tussenrost, for this sword was the only way to defeat a Wise Man. &#xA;&#xA;But Gloom could not hold it, for Gloom is known for his cunning, not his strength. And the Sleeper took up the sword.</string>
<string id="3764">But the...</string>
<string id="3765">If not for Gloom, there would have been no Godmassacre, so I understand. So be sure to appease him with abundant offerings, for Gloom is indeed mischievous and vindictive.&#xA;&#xA;Thus it happened. And the battle began, among the very gods! The heavens were engulfed in flame!&#xA;&#xA;Their arms, and legs, and other assorted parts rained down upon mortals, and their blood with it, filling the worlds with fire!&#xA;&#xA;It was the Godmassacre...</string>
<string id="3766">Pause the nightmare story for a moment. What was that about Alglemy?</string>
<string id="3767">Huh?</string>
<string id="3768">Svefnii lay with this Alglemy. And?</string>
<string id="3769">Ah, I see what you are getting at.&#xA;&#xA;So the Sleeper lay with Alglemy at length and with great passion, as a strong warrior. The heavens and the earth trembled at their love. For Alglemy's passion was great, and full of love. And the Sleeper never grew tired!</string>
<string id="3770">Whoa.</string>
<string id="3771">And so they loved, and loved long.&#xA;&#xA;But she betrayed the Sleeper, plunging the knife of her womanly treachery into his back. And his blood fell upon the earth, and seized the world in flame. People, cities, countries burned!</string>
<string id="3772">Oof.</string>
<string id="3773">And so Gloom...</string>
<string id="3774">Wait, what happened with Alglemy and the Sleeper?</string>
<string id="3775">You and your Alglemy...&#xA;&#xA;She was a traitor! She betrayed our Svefnii, as it is written. And the only conversation one may have with a traitor is...</string>
<string id="3776">A very short one?</string>
<string id="3777">Indeed!&#xA;&#xA;Svefnii stood on one leg, so the scriptures say, and pulled the other.&#xA;&#xA;And thus her story ended.&#xA;&#xA;And...</string>
<string id="3778">And her blood did rain upon the earth, engulfing it in fire, and all did come to burning, yes, I guessed as much.</string>
<string id="3779">Holza the Spinstress</string>
<string id="3780">Holza the Spinstress, Old Holza, is the Mother of Time and the Mistress of Fate. She is the patroness of time.&#xA;&#xA;She weaves her Eternal Tapestry of Fate, working in all that must happen to us unworthy mortals, and mayhap even all that may happen to the gods themselves. None have ever looked upon her face, not even the gods, yet they call her the Old, perhaps for her great wisdom, or perhaps she is indeed as old as the pants I wear.&#xA;&#xA;The gods love not Holza for her wisdom. Gloom the Horny is especially contrary to her.&#xA;&#xA;When you do wish to appease the Mother of Time, take a strong basket and place therein two or three pounds of meat, dried or cooked fish, a loaf of bread wrapped in a clean rag, a flask or two of khtynka – two is better, yes. And place there also a new pair of pants.&#xA;&#xA;Float all of this down the river. Only give me warning first, according to the scriptures, when you have deemed it right to give an offering to Holza. I shall... ensure your sacrifice reaches its destination.</string>
<string id="3781">Kallente</string>
<string id="3782">Kallente is the goddess of beauty, motherhood, and fertility. She is patroness of the hearth and home, and thus of the lovers' embrace. &#xA;&#xA;Were you a girl of succulence, I would tell you how to serve Kallente. Ahem.&#xA;&#xA;Go ahead and ask Karegast. He is an expert on serving Kallente, hah!</string>
<string id="3783">Amate-Maksha, the Sunmaiden</string>
<string id="3784">The Sunmaiden, called Amate by us, Amate-Maksha by the Slavards, and Amat'i by the Khoors.&#xA;&#xA;She is eternally young and unspeakably beautiful, the Fiery-rayed, giving us fire and light.&#xA;&#xA;Know that the beauty of any woman is but a reflection of the countenance of the Sunmaiden. The marks of her patronage are blond or white hair.</string>
<string id="3785">Amate the Sun and Velent the Hasty are sisters. And so the two of them are often called "the Sisters." Our high priests say the Sisters meet during times of eclipse and determine matters of life and death for their chosen people, those with the mark of the Sleeper, their brother, making such determinations without consideration of the Sleeper's will. So the wisest Accurs have written upon the Tablets of Risterverden.&#xA;&#xA;Amate the Sun has no interest in the affairs of mortals, and barely any interest in the affairs of the gods. Only her own interests concern her.&#xA;&#xA;Her world is Izenlen.</string>
<string id="3786">Velent-Ellyanae</string>
<string id="3787">Velent-Ellyanae, which is interpreted Velent the Hasty.&#xA;Called Velent the Dark, Velent-An-Maksha, and Mother Night by the Slavards and Kharanhoo by the Khoors.&#xA;&#xA;Her scythe is sharp and silver and cuts short our lives in the night.&#xA;&#xA;She is patroness of all under the shadow of her dark cloak. Her time is night, the time of dark deeds.&#xA;&#xA;She is Amate's twin sister, but of the darkness, not the light.&#xA;&#xA;Dark brown or black hair is the mark of Velent's patronage.&#xA;&#xA;Her world is Izenlen.</string>
<string id="3788">Terskel and the Three</string>
<string id="3789">Terskel is the one-armed warrior who keeps eternal vigil over the walls of Terrskellen, the ring world, the wall world barring access to the world of the Sleeper, Risterverden.&#xA;&#xA;It is a cold, icy world, isolating the fiery Risterverden from the other worlds.&#xA;&#xA;"In the Godmassacre, Terskel blew a great alarm on his horn Rivelim, signaling Aori to smash the silver brace of the heavenly sphere. Terskel's other arm, severed by the Ereborns, still grasps the bellowing horn Rivelim and ever floats throughout space, circling the world of humanity. As the elders will tell you, that horn still sounds forth. Sometimes, when the night is especially dark and quiet, you can hear it."&#xA;&#xA;Along with Terskel, eternal vigil on the wall is kept by the Three Nameless Ice Knezi. There are more Knezi, twelve in total.</string>
<string id="3790">Johdenandhe, the Dead Maiden</string>
<string id="3791">The Maiden of the Red Scythe, the Cold One, the Iceeyed, called Amghooy by the Khoors and Lei by the northerners&#xA;&#xA;She is the goddess of death!&#xA;Her world, Smertverden, lies between the world of men, Sparksvaard, and the world of the Sleeper, Risterverden.&#xA;&#xA;The Slavards say that all who die of old age and all who lose their sword or shame themselves on the field of battle are sent to the bed of Johdenandhe. There, she extinguishes their Spark once and for all with her "embrace of love." When Johdenandhe embraces something, nothing remains.&#xA;&#xA;But true warriors – godlike heroes inflamed with fury who give their lives in battle – fly through the world of the Iceeyed, blazing holes through her ensnaring bedsheets.</string>
<string id="3792">Sheesh!</string>
<string id="3793">Beyond lies the Sleeper's Forge, and then his Hammer and his Anvil, awaiting all true heroes.&#xA;For the Sleeping God is forging the Sparks of the dead together into a great blade of Vengeance.&#xA;&#xA;But not all are worthy of this, and so not all make it through the Forge.&#xA;&#xA;Johde regularly manifests herself in the world of humans, summoning to herself three of the Twelve Nameless Ice Knezi – three of which keep vigil on the walls of Terskellen, and nine of which guard the breach in the heavenly dome. She summons them, for she knows their names, and to know their names is to have authority over them. When she does this, winter comes to Sparksvaard.&#xA;&#xA;It is believed that should Johde call all of the Ice Knezi at once, eternal winter and the kingdom of death will dawn in the world of humans!&#xA;&#xA;We Gottlungs simply offer her lambs, and that is well and good.&#xA;Especially when the lambs are young and well fed. Offering them up as a burnt offering, with khtynka, that pleases us Accurs greatly! And to please the Accurs is to please Johde.&#xA;&#xA;But she does greatly adore freshly shed blood.</string>
<string id="3794">Jomfrutotte</string>
<string id="3795">The Iceeyed's younger sister.&#xA;&#xA;The messenger of her older sister, Death, she personally comes to collect the Sparks of the dead. She is always among us!&#xA;&#xA;She is curious, like unto all of our gods, and may watch you, especially in acts of battle or love. It is known. She takes interest in mortal affairs.&#xA;&#xA;This is why our maidens who are especially shy devise implements of modesty before the various entertainments of love. Some may hide their face with a handkerchief while upon the bed, while others fall prostrate upon it and offer prayers to Kallente, that she may hinder Jomfru and send them a child, so the scriptures say.&#xA;&#xA;Jodenande and Jomfrutotte are often confused for one another, and indeed the distinction between them touches us little, but the older survives on human Sparks, and the younger on pain and the thirst for survival that ignites within us as we approach death.&#xA;&#xA;The Younger Sister brings our Sparks to the Older Sister, as one might bring a gift of a basket of mushrooms.</string>
<string id="3796">Sófaþek-king</string>
<string id="3797">The warrior of the Throne of Wisdom, he is the god of knowledge and wise council, which he possesses in abundance.&#xA;These he shares abundantly with all, whether they stand in need of it or no.&#xA;&#xA;He reclines on his soft bench with its soft back – and his eyes, burned out in Godernblodbad, see through the whole realm of existence.&#xA;&#xA;To us Accurs he grants his wisdom without ceasing, so whene'er you require counsel, do not hesitate to come. And forget not to bring a lamb.</string>
<string id="3798">Do you know any legends?</string>
<string id="3799">I know a multitude of legends! But my throat is overly dry to tell them.</string>
<string id="3800">Shall I bring you some khtynka?</string>
<string id="3801">Your intellect impresses. Bring me some, and I shall quench my thirst and tell you however much you desire.&#xA;&#xA;You shall never hear such wisdom elsewhere, so hurry.</string>
<string id="3802">I shall bring the brew.</string>
<string id="3803">I have khtynka for you. Shall we drink?</string>
<string id="3804">Give it here.&#xA;&#xA;'Tis my drink, not yours. But I shall drink to your health. To our gods! *gulp*</string>
<string id="3805">I have heard that the gods desire a diversity of things.</string>
<string id="3806">Oh, woe is me! &#xA;Wherefore have you removed your favor from me, O gods?&#xA;&#xA;I am smitten by fate, as a cow pie by a boot...</string>
<string id="3807">Huh?</string>
<string id="3808">Oh gods, oh gods!&#xA;Why?</string>
<string id="3809">Has something happened?</string>
<string id="3810">Who is here?</string>
<string id="3811">It is I, as before.</string>
<string id="3812">Aha!&#xA;Here is a good one who shall help me perform an act for the glory of the gods!&#xA;The messenger of the gods who shall help me fulfill what Gloom has predetermined for me this day!&#xA;&#xA;Hearken, O messenger.&#xA;*he whispers in your ear*</string>
<string id="3813">Calm yourself, Father. She is imagining her children again, with much mention of Johde...</string>
<string id="3814">Johde, you say? Then the sacrifice to Kallente must needs wait. And Khoytu-khanir also possesses a scythe, like unto that of Jode – though it be not yet red.&#xA;&#xA;Gloom we shall delight instead!&#xA;&#xA;For that end, you must...&#xA;*he whispers in your ear*</string>
<string id="3815">What? Pinch fireleaf from the elder? What has gotten into you, Father?</string>
<string id="3816">Hush now, lower your voice.&#xA;Yes, his fireleaf, that shall please Gloom.&#xA;&#xA;Proceed with all stealth and caution into the community house and find therein a chest. Take the fireleaf from that same chest and bring it to me, to the glory of the gods.&#xA;&#xA;You shall often have need of this skill in Abella, moving about quietly and sharing everything, for you shall have good neighbors there. And Gloom wills that we live with our neighbors in peace and shared prosperity! So learn the way, then, while I still live, and let us have Gloom well pleased.&#xA;&#xA;Go now!</string>
<string id="3817">Well, since it is for Gloom...</string>
<string id="3818">I have the fireleaf, Father, but I am worried that the elder shall hold me to account for it.</string>
<string id="3819">I have the fireleaf, Father, but I am worried that the elder shall hold me to account for it.</string>
<string id="3820">Be at peace, child. All is under control. We shall make our offering to Gloom, and all shall pass.&#xA;&#xA;In the meantime, here is the reward you have earned.</string>
<string id="3821">This is all mine? Why, thank you!</string>
<string id="3822">Asoveh, Wise One! Tell me of Abella</string>
<string id="3823">Of that, I am always glad to tell! &#xA;Abella is an island of eternal blessing and blessedness. Every mortal who comes to Abella finds what he or she dreams of finding, for so it is written in our ancient scriptures.&#xA;&#xA;There, the warrior shall find eternal battle and victory. The farmer, perpetual peace and prosperity. The craftsman, worthy work to the glory of himself and the gods. The king there shall find faithful subjects, and the subjects shall find a good, just ruler.&#xA;Aye, and the slave shall find a good master, and the master a submissive slave.&#xA;There the artist shall have no lack of paints, the butcher of meats, and the harlot of clients.&#xA;&#xA;All is fair and just in Abella!</string>

<string id="3827">I hear you. No need to yell. What do you want?</string>
<string id="3828">Teach me how to smelt.</string>
<string id="3829">Tell me, why do all insist I speak with the elder?</string>
<string id="3830">They are afraid.</string>
<string id="3831">Of me?</string>
<string id="3832">No, of the gods.&#xA;&#xA;Our elder is a man of special quality. His gift is to see what is hidden. He shall see you, and if he recognizes any seal of foreign gods, he shall pronounce his word, and you shall hang to wither under the gaze of Amate.&#xA;&#xA;A rope around your neck.</string>
<string id="3833">But you are not afraid?</string>
<string id="3834">I am a blacksmith. We have our own... accounts with the gods.</string>
<string id="3835">So you are favored? Do you speak with them?</string>
<string id="3836">No one speaks with the gods. They issue commands, and you must decide for yourself how to respond.</string>
<string id="3837">How does one respond if they simply issue commands, without any regard for our will?</string>
<string id="3838">Respond wisely.&#xA;&#xA;It is not always best to bow before them, before our gods especially. Aorik was right, he was right, yet I did not believe...&#xA;&#xA;Our elder listened to their commands, and covered the island with idols.&#xA;And then with gallows, to hang men and women like you who come to this place.</string>
<string id="3839">Huh.</string>
<string id="3840">Aye. Wanted to serve all the gods. But the gods are jealous, and none can serve all of them. And they are harsh, as well, for all of them require many sacrifices. They thirst for blood.&#xA;And for our Sparks...</string>

<string id="3848">What? I am busy.&#xA;I must forge this sword... Sword...&#xA;Ul... Ule... Ulf...&#xA;&#xA;Begone! Now!</string>
<string id="3849">I take my leave.</string>
<string id="3850">I want to learn how to forge. Tell me about working with metal.</string>
<string id="3851">You? About metalworking? Well, hearken, then.&#xA;&#xA;For metalworking, you shall require:&#xA;First, a pickax and an ore mine.&#xA;Second, diligence and the aid of the Sleeper, first Smith of our world.&#xA;&#xA;Third, a bloomery, to melt the ore. Therein you need a crucible and coal or logs to fuel its fire.&#xA;&#xA;Finally, you require a hammer.&#xA;&#xA;Is that sufficient?</string>

<string id="3853">I get it now... I think.</string>
<string id="3854">I get it now... I think.</string>
<string id="3855">ere, listen.&#xA;&#xA;Take some ore and place it into a furnace or a kiln. Heat it up.&#xA;You'll need some fuel for that first. You could use some billets for it, but you'll run dry quick. Better get some coal.&#xA;You can get charcoal from burning the billets in a kiln.&#xA;&#xA;So. Raise the temperature as high as a thousand degrees continuously. Keep an eye on your charcoal.&#xA;When the ore is heated up, you can melt the bars. For that, you need a crucible.&#xA;&#xA;Now hand me the ore, I could use it.</string>
<string id="3856">Okay, I get it. Gotta go.</string>
<string id="3857">Okay, I get it. Gotta go.</string>
<string id="3858">Got it! I will try.</string>
<string id="3859">Got it! I will try.</string>
<string id="3860">Very well. From the beginning.&#xA;&#xA;To forge something, you require ingots. I shall not provide them for you – many like you have come before, and you all just waste good metal. But there is another way.&#xA;&#xA;We mine ore from the nearby mine, which perhaps you have seen. Take your pickax there and mine however much ore you need, but take care not to break the pickax in the process.</string>

<string id="3862">Well, you seem pretty interested...&#xA;&#xA;How does one forge? You don't, with that much experience. Hm-m, I guess nails should do.. it doesn't take a lot to make a nail.&#xA;&#xA;Well, if you can figure it out, here's a free anvil and hammer. Care for it, and try not to break it.&#xA;Take some lumps of iron in the crate, they'll come in handy.</string>

<string id="3864">Nah, it's nothing.</string>
<string id="3865">I see you already have a hammer. If you break it, forge another.</string>

<string id="3870">Might I treat you with some fireleaf during our conversation?</string>
<string id="3871">You rich in fireleaf?</string>
<string id="3872">You rich in fireleaf?</string>
<string id="3873">Not especially. I simply have a question.</string>
<string id="3874">Then let us hear it.</string>
<string id="3875">I am in need of an ax for a certain job.</string>
<string id="3876">Take one from the chest, then. But be sure to return it thither.</string>
<string id="3877">You have my thanks. And one more question.</string>
<string id="3878">Duty calls. Farewell.</string>
<string id="3879">Might you lend me a saw? I am providing assistance to the carpenter.</string>
<string id="3880">There is a saw in the chest. Break it, though, and I shall smash you into the earth.</string>
<string id="3881">There is a saw in the chest. Take care not to break it.</string>
<string id="3882">I brought the ore. Ugh, it's so heavy.</string>
<string id="3883">What'd you expect?&#xA;&#xA;Now ore should be melted down. I guess I could tell you what's what... but you won't be able to melt it 'ere. You need skill and experience for that.</string>
<string id="3884">I seek a metal shovel.</string>
<string id="3885">Retrieve it from the chest.</string>
<string id="3886">I wish to ask about the island.</string>
<string id="3887">Ask, then.</string>
<string id="3888">What is that tower of ships you have?</string>
<string id="3889">Ships stacked in a tower, you say? I see nothing but a cold, bright light. So that's how it is, then, huh...</string>
<string id="3890">Why are so many hanging here?</string>
<string id="3891">Our elder, following the voices in his head, incites the people to make sacrifices to the gods. In an attempt to please them. The fool.</string>
<string id="3892">I see you are building a ship...</string>
<string id="3893">We are. Abella awaits us.</string>
<string id="3894">Tell me about Abella</string>
<string id="3895">Abella is an island.&#xA;&#xA;There is located Turneskangen, the Tower of the Branch,&#xA;raised by the Lord to protect the Branch of the World Tree there. The Branches grow through all inhabited and uninhabited worlds, through the worlds of men and gods both, and perhaps even further.&#xA;&#xA;As my grandfather would tell me, this Branch purifies our world, making rulers just and wise and commoners as happy as children.&#xA;&#xA;And so we all yearn to go to Abella.</string>
<string id="3896">Gods be good, that has the sound of magic to it. Does it grant wishes?</string>
<string id="3897">Who?</string>
<string id="3898">The Branch?</string>
<string id="3899">Pfft. Not even our cook listens to wishes. Much less the Branch. Perhaps you should go check. Then you can tell me!</string>

<string id="3911">What do you want?</string>
<string id="3912">What do you want?</string>
<string id="3913">I've been assigned by the Elder to help the village. Should I plow the fields or something?</string>
<string id="3914">A good, eh-h... aspiration!&#xA;&#xA;It's too late for plowing, though, but it's a great time for harvest.&#xA;See what's there on our fields, gather what's growing from the land, and bring it back to our Hoytu-right-hanir. She'll have it all cooked right for the dinner.&#xA;&#xA;And watch it! Don't stamp our fields too much.</string>
<string id="3915">Tell me about farming.</string>
<string id="3916">Agreed.&#xA;&#xA;Farming be our whole basis for life here. 'Tis how we live!&#xA;Everyone be always wanting to eat. What do you want to eat?</string>
<string id="3917">I eat whatever I can get my mouth on.</string>
<string id="3918">Then you be like my wife, peace on her ashes.&#xA;&#xA;Fruits and vegetables, and all else edible that be growing from the earth, for cooking, for food, to eat. All be in need of eating. When you be full, you learn to craft and forge faster, but a hungry man, now he be a slow man, he be thinking of nothing but food. And be having nowhere to get it, heehee.</string>
<string id="3919">Flax, now that be something I respect, too. You cannot eat it beyond its seeds, but you can be wearing a shirt or pants spun from it. But to make them, you be needing skill.</string>
<string id="3920">I have more questions.</string>
<string id="3921">*Karegast scratches his beard*</string>
<string id="3922">I have questions about farming.</string>
<string id="3923">I be pleased to answer, then.</string>
<string id="3924">How can I grow a good harvest?</string>
<string id="3925">Growing a good harvest be a thing of great wisdom, passed from our ancestors to us. It be to feed the whole village. Hunters and fishers, that be a thing of great fortune or no, blessing of the gods or no. But to guarantee food for all people, that be found nowhere but in farming.&#xA;&#xA;Yet it be not easy. First, you select a field, and plough the soil, and see that the seeds be not rotten, and be guessing well the weather. And when the land be good, the harvest be good.&#xA;&#xA;For a surety, be not forgetful to appease the gods, for luck.&#xA;You be needing much time for all of this, for farming cannot be hurried.</string>
<string id="3926">I have another question.</string>
<string id="3927">How can I "guess well" the weather?</string>
<string id="3928">No way to do that. But for your crop to be prosperous, the weather need be rotating. Shining of the sun, then raining of the sky, then the shining of Amate once again. Then, be it by the rule, your crop will grow.</string>
<string id="3929">How do I plough the land?</string>
<string id="3930">Well, I be with a question, now. Where did you come from, and how did they not take you? How to plough, good be the gods...&#xA;&#xA;We plough with a plough, of a certainty! The plough be a fickle device, perilous for people like you. You be in need of skill, as always!&#xA;&#xA;To make a plough, you be needing wheels, iron for the ploughshare, five pieces of linen, and wood.&#xA;&#xA;Then be at watch you only plough fertile land. Keep an eye on the land, to be wary of clay, sand, rocks. Remember, fertile soil.</string>

Reputation of a newcomer, all clumsy and amateur, prone to be breaking things.&#xA;&#xA;Calm yourself, this be a better idea: a chest be behind the shed. In it be wheels and other important parts. So you make a plough for yourself.&#xA;&#xA;I be your source of advice, if you find ought in which you need advising. Happy to be of help.</string>

<string id="3935">Could you share some fireleaf for our time together?</string>
<string id="3936">Would that I could, I be holding no greed and no stinginess towards a good person like yourself.&#xA;&#xA;But if you be offering, then of course, I say yes. Laws of Kalle be against me insulting you by turning you away.</string>
<string id="3937">Wait, what?</string>
<string id="3938">You be deaf, I see. Happens.&#xA;&#xA;I had a grandmother who was deaf, could not hear a thing, mayhap that be why she died being one hundred. Meaning she be too deaf to hear the calls of Johde and Jomfru. So the gods could not call her to take her.&#xA;As so she would be living still, likely, to this day, except the gods be fed up with her and dropped a log on her.&#xA;&#xA;Our life here be hard, I say. Hard as hell. On the island no dwelling to be built, no escape to be made. Only joys be eating and drinking khtynka.&#xA;&#xA;And smoking of course. Oh right, you be deaf.&#xA;&#xA;I SAID, BE YOU IN POSSESSION OF ANY FIRELEAF?</string>

<string id="3940">Uh, I'm... here. Some fireleaf for you.</string>
<string id="3941">Now that be a different matter!&#xA;With pleasure, we smoke to the glory of the gods, and most of all Kalle, Homekeeper she be.&#xA;&#xA;And we be right to converse on our lives. If you be here with any questions, ask.&#xA;&#xA;I be willing to answer!</string>

<string id="3943">I remember nothing from the time I crawled up onto this island's shore.</string>
<string id="3944">So it goes, so it be with us all here. As I be of understanding, Gloom jokes with the heads of all who come to the island.&#xA;&#xA;But we be accustomed to it, now, sometimes even shaking out pieces of memory from our minds, recalling what be forgotten.</string>
<string id="3945">Tell me more about the gods.</string>
<string id="3946">What be there to say of them? Our task it be to please them. I be in the know of all a farmer needs to know of it.&#xA;&#xA;When you be in need of pleasing Gloom, wait for the moon to rise, drink some khtynka, then some sour milk, then go to your neighbor's field and relieve yourself there.&#xA;&#xA;Then Gloom will be pleased and you will be unharmed by him for a time. Until the moon sets once more, that is.&#xA;That is, when Velent cloaks not her beauty.&#xA;&#xA;Gloom be a lover of jokes. And plays many jokes himself. Though his jokes be rarely loved by those they be upon.&#xA;&#xA;So we farmers joke instead on one another, pleasing Gloom while Velent flies disrobed across the sky.&#xA;&#xA;All I know about the gods be all I need to know. If you be wanting to hear legends on them, go speak with our Accur.&#xA;&#xA;As the man says about me when he be drunk, I be a "pract *hic* al man." Not a man for legends.</string>
<string id="3947">Can you tell me of another?</string>
<string id="3948">Kalle of the Generous Womb be the one we farmers venerate.&#xA;She blesses and multiplies our harvest.&#xA;&#xA;When you be of the desire that your harvest abound, and no hail strike your crops, you turn your eye to your field...</string>
<string id="3949">Kalle of the Generous Womb be the one we farmers venerate.&#xA;She blesses and multiplies our harvest.&#xA;&#xA;When you be of the desire that your harvest abound, and no hail strike your crops, you turn your man's eye to your field...</string>
<string id="3950">Also at nighttime?</string>
<string id="3951">I see you be of a reasonable mind. Well done!&#xA;&#xA;Yes, at night. Under the cover of Velent's cloak when the field is best sown.</string>
<string id="3952">I see you be of a reasonable mind. Well done!&#xA;&#xA;Yes, at night. Under the cover of Velent's cloak when the field is best sown.</string>
<string id="3953">Do you need some khtynka for this?</string>
<string id="3954">Khtynka? Well, if there be some.&#xA;&#xA;Drink some and go on the field. Kallente be a woman adoring the pleasures of love, and in the springtime she enters the earth, so...&#xA;&#xA;Be sure you seize luck by the tail! Follow to the field, for Kalle will be waiting there for you.&#xA;&#xA;And how well you please her, that rich will your harvest be.&#xA;My field is always in the ear.&#xA;&#xA;Not so my neighbors'.</string>
<string id="3955">Khtynka? Well, if there be some.&#xA;&#xA;Drink some and go on the field. Kallente be a woman adoring the pleasures of love, and in the springtime she enters the earth, so...&#xA;&#xA;Be sure your man seize luck by the tail! Tell him to watch your field, for Kalle will be waiting there for him.&#xA;&#xA;And if he be pleasing to Kalle, so will the harvest be pleasing to you.&#xA;And so my field be always in the ear.&#xA;&#xA;Not so my neighbors'.</string>
<string id="3956">Farming is far from simple, I see.</string>
<string id="3957">I fear I have none.</string>
<string id="3958">Then be not a bother to busy people. I wish your departure well.</string>
<string id="3959">What is that tower of ships you have here?</string>
<string id="3960">Heehee, I can see Khoytu's khtynka be getting to you. It be pleasing to me, too, but drinking enough to see a tower of ships? That experience be not mine, as of yet. Or did you mayhap eat something... special? Be not secretive. Share! Perhaps I also be of the desire to see this tower of ships.</string>
<string id="3961">Heehee, I can see Khoytu's khtynka be getting to you. It be pleasing to me, too, but drinking enough to see a tower of ships? That experience be not mine, as of yet. Or did you mayhap eat something... special? Be not secretive. Share! Perhaps I also be of the desire to see this tower of ships.</string>
<string id="3962">And why are so many people hanging here?</string>
<string id="3963">They be monsters of men, being in refusal to recognize our gods, especially my dear Kallente, whom they were not of a desire to please, on my very field. So we hung them, to please the gods.&#xA;&#xA;Another benefit of this be that the crows turn more eye to them than to my crops!</string>
<string id="3964">I see you are building a ship...</string>
<string id="3965">It be a marvelous ship, to carry us through the frigid sea, to the island which be of blessing and blessedness, Abella!</string>
<string id="3966">Tell me about Abella</string>
<string id="3967">Abella be a wondrous island of eternal blessing and blessedness. My grandfather said, and his grandfather before him, and his grandfather and great-grandfather before him, that wheat grows on the island all year around. Untended!&#xA;&#xA;With ears the size of a woman's breast! So it be unnecessary to reap and sow but just to reach out your hand, pluck, and fill your belly for the day...&#xA;&#xA;And the fireleaf there be strong and abundant! And so rich the gods themselves descend to partake. And Kalle walks the fields all year, always ready for, I mean...</string>
<string id="3968">Merciful is the Lord.</string>
<string id="3969">Who is that?</string>
<string id="3970">The one who created heaven and earth. And you and me.</string>
<string id="3971">Ah, is that your god?</string>
<string id="3972">He is not mine, but I am his. As are you, though you reside in darkness.</string>
<string id="3973">Uh, right, well I offer sacrifices to Svefnii the Fiery One, into the earth. And to Gloom. And to Kallente. And to whomever else.</string>
<string id="3974">Their name is legion.&#xA;&#xA;If I had use of my arm, I would teach you how one should make sacrifices in nomine Dei! But the Lord is at work enlightening me with humility, and now my word is my weapon.</string>
<string id="3975">Ask your question.</string>
<string id="3976">Your look is different from that of the locals. Where do you hail from?</string>
<string id="3977">From far away. From a place called the Eternal City.</string>
<string id="3978">You were a warrior?</string>
<string id="3979">I was. And so I still am.</string>
<string id="3980">So you were a warrior, but your speech sounds like that of the Accur. Who are you?</string>
<string id="3981">Just a humble servant of God, who with the blessing of Father Clement the Peacemaker has been entrusted to bear the light of the true faith into the darkness of ignorance.&#xA;Be it by word or sword.</string>
<string id="3982">So he is your father, this one who created worlds. Meaning you are his Son, Lightbearer. Got it.</string>
<string id="3983">So he is your father, this one who created worlds. Meaning you are his Son, Lightbearer. Got it.</string>
<string id="3984">Lord grant me longsuffering...</string>
<string id="3985">What is this place?</string>
<string id="3986">A circus. By the locals, called an Arena. A place for games and bloody spectacles.</string>
<string id="3987">I have noticed that this island's people have no place for violence, but sometimes I feel I could do for a good fight.</string>
<string id="3988">I have noticed that this island's people have no place for violence, but sometimes I feel I could do for a good fight.</string>
<string id="3989">Here, you may fight. Come spill blood in the Arena!</string>
<string id="3990">The people hung around the island are dressed as you are...</string>
<string id="3991">You are quite observant.</string>
<string id="3992">You are quite observant.</string>
<string id="3993">So that leads to the question, if you were their comrade, why are they hanging but you are not?</string>
<string id="3994">Even in the souls of the heathen, the Lord sometimes instills mercy. A battle raged between my brethren and the inhabitants of this island. I was wounded, nay, hacked apart, covered in sword slashes, and was offered to one of your idols.&#xA;&#xA;But the mercy of God was shown to me, by the hand of the blacksmith, and delivered me from the Accur's rusty knife. And made the elder remember compassion.&#xA;&#xA;Then a good woman whose name I cannot hope to pronounce nursed me to health, and my place came to be this Arena.</string>
<string id="3995">As you are a warrior, can you teach me a warrior's skill?</string>
<string id="3996">I shall not teach you.</string>
<string id="3997">Then at least give me some advice. In battle, what is the most important of all?</string>
<string id="3998">You again...</string>
<string id="3999">Asoveh! Will you advise me now? What is the most important thing of all in combat?</string>
<string id="4000">Many things are important.&#xA;&#xA;Watch your breathing so that you have the strength to strike or dodge when the critical moment comes. This is called stamina. Limit your movement – do not run around, jump, or wave your weapon for no purpose. Be of a cold and calculating mind, saving your energy for when the time is right. And when that time comes, do not miss it.</string>

<string id="4184">The northerners have never been particularly skilled shoemakers, and these boots are proof of that.

<string id="4185">Roughly made fingerless gauntlets made of thick, coarse leather.</string>

<string id="4197">Woven chain gauntlets with a soft wolf-fur lining.</string>

<string id="4203">Well-made chain-mail gauntlets. They are lined with thick, fluffy fur and laced with red ribbon.</string>
<string id="4204">Leggings like a layer cake. They feature canvas with runes sewn into them, leather for durability, and fur for warmth. They are reinforced with a chain netting. Few spears can pierce leggings such as these.</string>
<string id="4205">Sewn to fit the foot precisely, these chain-mail boots will serve their owner faithfully through many battles and campaigns. Bear fur coated with lard protects against the fiercest frost, and the talismans and runes sewn into the crimson lining protect against other manners of peril.</string>

<string id="4215">Gauntlets made of solid leather with long, broad cuffs designed to resemble Gottlung plate gauntlets. The fingers are made of dark leather and are more finely crafted.</string>
<string id="4216">These leggings are made of coarse leather and reinforced with riveted patches in the most vulnerable places.</string>
<string id="4217">Leather boots with thick, spongy soles. Instead of laces, the calves are wrapped in several soft straps.</string>
<string id="4218">This heavy helm only looks like pure leather – both the helm and its flaps are actually made of steel plates riveted together and covered with leather and tooled designs.</string>
<string id="4219">This leather armor is somewhat reminiscent of plate mail – it has plates covering the chest and shoulders and a gorget to protect the neck, and it weighs a little less than plate mail.</string>
<string id="4220">Each of these bracers are assembled from a dozen steel plates sewn into leather sleeves covering the forearms. They are tightened using laces.</string>
<string id="4221">Heavy, well-made gauntlets made of boiled leather. They are reinforced with steel scales sewn into the top. The fingers are made of thin, light leather.</string>
<string id="4222">Broad leggings with barely noticeable strips of riveted leather. They are well made and soft, yet durable.</string>
<string id="4223">Heavy boots made of matte leather. They are double-stitched and painstakingly made. Both the boots themselves and the straps on them are adorned with buckles and rivets in various shapes.</string>
<string id="4224">A heavy helm made of steel with richly decorated, tooled leather sewn around it. The edging and patterns are gilded.</string>
<string id="4225">A leather cuirass with steel plates sewn into it and a blood-red collar made of thin leather. Buckles and tiny fasteners, dozens of rivets – it's all gilded and shines with a noble luster.</string>
<string id="4226">Thick plates of tempered steel are sewn beneath dyed red leather covered with tooled patterns.</string>
<string id="4227">These solid, expensive-looking gauntlets are covered with thin plates of gilded steel. The fingers are made of strips of black boiled leather, and the insides of the gauntlets are made of soft, red satin.</string>
<string id="4228">Thick laced leggings made of specially treated leather. They are covered with riveted leather patches to protect the knees and calves.</string>
<string id="4229">Boots made of expensive, soft leather. They are decorated with gilded iron buckles and dark red leather straps.</string>
<string id="4230">A coarse, quilted, laced helm. It is stuffed with something that's not quite oakum and not quite fur and is permeated with salt to the point of crackling.</string>
<string id="4231">A puffy quilted jacket stitched with horsehair. It is stuffed with scrap fabric and oakum and gives off a light, musty aroma.</string>
<string id="4232">These aren't bracers at all – they're linen rags fastened on with thin straps with no buckles.</string>
<string id="4233">Quilted fingerless gloves. They make a crunching sound when you make a fist in them – there must be straw inside. They might look rustic, but they provide some protection against arrows.</string>
<string id="4234">Linen pants with bindings sewn along rough, wobbly seams in a criss-cross pattern. There are patches made of folded-over pieces of sackcloth on the knees.</string>
<string id="4235">Short boots made of solid fabric soaked in lard.</string>
<string id="4236">A laced quilted helm with ear flaps. It is made thicker with waste cloth around the top of the head, nape of the neck, and temples and stuffed with matted wool.</string>
<string id="4237">A puffy quilted helm stuffed with cloth scraps and matted wool hidden under a raggedy boar's head with it's eyes sewn shut.</string>
<string id="4238">A quilted jacket made of several layers of solid linen with sleeves and an insulated back and lower back. Soaked in salt and stuffed with oakum and waste cloth.</string>
<string id="4239">Pieces of white linen cloth folded into several layers and carefully sewn into rather sturdy bracers.</string>
<string id="4240">Quilted gauntlets insulated with boar fur. Their solid leather lining provides good protection for the hands and preserves warmth.</string>
<string id="4241">Insulated cloth pants with rhombuses sewn onto the knees and calves.</string>
<string id="4242">Tall boots. They're warm, but hastily made. It's almost as if they're inside out, with seams on the outside and fur on the inside.</string>
<string id="4243">A helm made of strips of coarse, uneven iron riveted onto a thick quilted lining stuffed with oakum and fur. The warrior's face is protected by an iron half-mask.</string>
<string id="4244">The head of this old, battle-scarred boar makes an excellent helm – it has solid lining with strips of leather sewn into it and a steel skull cap with a half-mask that covers the warrior's eyes and nose.</string>
<string id="4245">A quilted tunic. It is sturdy and has a fur lining soaked in salt casks. It is covered with ribbons of thick, hard leather in a criss-cross pattern.</string>
<string id="4246">Broad bracers made of tanned leather with a cloth lining.</string>
<string id="4247">Warm gloves made of leather and lined with cloth scraps and horsehair.</string>
<string id="4248">Puffy cloth pants sewn from three layers of fabric with oakum and straw stuffed between them. They're warm, and they can take a hit well.</string>
<string id="4249">These boots look shapeless, but on the inside they have high wooden soles, hard leather legs that cling to the calves, and fur lining.</string>
<string id="4250">This helm's steel ribs are hidden under a boar's head stuffed full of scraps of cloth and leather.</string>
<string id="4251">Heavy padded armor made of three layers of dyed linen. Under a lining of black boar fur hides coarse, solid fabric with strips of leather sewn into it.</string>
<string id="4252">Bracers the color of frozen blood. They are made of leather, stuffed with matted wool, and carefully riveted in a circle.</string>
<string id="4253">Judging from their softness and flexibility, these gauntlets are made of calfskin that has been treated and prepared in a special way. On the inside they are sewn like padded armor and lined with numerous rivets that are hard to spot in the thick fur lining.</string>
<string id="4254">Thick linen leggings made from four layers of crimson fabric with layers of horsehair and matted wool in-between.</string>
<string id="4255">These boots are made of solid, rough leather with red fabric sewn around them. They are insulated with thick fur.</string>
<string id="4256">A two-handed sword with a long hilt wrapped in tawed straps. It has a short ricasso and a sharp, heavy blade with deeply engraved runes.</string>
<string id="4257">A simple zweihander with short, three-edged fangs. It is surprisingly evenly sharpened. It is simply constructed, but made with noticeable skill and has a certain ineffable elegance to its appearance. The base of the blade has the words "ad patres" carved into it — a curt message to anyone who might stand in the way of this weapon's owner.</string>
<string id="4258">Mercenaries like these swords for their simple shape and perfect balance — the lead-filled hilt excellently balances the heavy blade with its long ricasso. "Ad hominem," intone the slender letters carved into the sword — an irony that perhaps only the sword's owner can appreciate.</string>
<string id="4259">The Eye of the Sleeper can be glimpsed in the gilded guard of this two-handed sword. The phrase "ultima ratio" is carved into the blade in ornamental script that is smooth and soft-edged, as though pressed into the surface of the sword.</string>
<string id="4260">This sword is a copy of the legendary lost sword known as "Terskel." Strips of studded leather form an intricate pattern on the hilt, and a gilded hand gripping the horn Rivelim form the fangs of this sword. The ornate guard is covered in a thin layer of gilt.</string>
<string id="4261">A massive, roughly forged axe on a long, light pole. It has a small butt and a curved blade with northern runes writ upon it in the shape of a crescent moon. Its rustic appearance is deceptive — this is a reliable weapon that is easy to wield and quite powerful for its weight.</string>
<string id="4262">This axe with a handle wrapped in strips of leather and a curved blade is not without a certain coarse, idiosyncratic beauty. Its charm may lie in the simple angular pattern carved inside of the axe — a hallmark of the northern blacksmiths.</string>
<string id="4263">A Slavard axe with a beveled butt and a long, straight, thick blade. In the northern lands this axe is known as a "bruiser's axe," as though calling attention to the weapon's personality and status.</string>
<string id="4264">An unusually thin axe handle on a straight pole wrapped in iron and leather strips. The blade is bronze-plated and covered in shallow, yet clearly visible runes. Like a spell whispered over the weapon by an enchanter, they protect the warrior from doom and misfortune.</string>
<string id="4265">Compared to the Slavards' artlessly simple weapons this axe is especially good. The dragon head on the butt with its whimsically winding gilded pattern is not just a frame for the sharp blade made from tempered steel – it is an ancient warrior's talisman, a special, almost palpable force that protects the axe's owner.</string>
<string id="4266">The kind of weapon an armed troll or a cannibal might wield. It looks truly terrifying. There are several notches – perhaps the number of the weapon's victims, or perhaps simply a design to enhance its beauty – on the pole made from dried pine. The toothed blade, which known neither runes, nor family crest, nor even a blacksmith's brand, has been sharpened unevenly, and the metal seems to be stained with blood.</string>
<string id="4267">Whether re-forged from a sword or an axe, this glaive has an odd shape and is adorned in the northern tradition. Its long, contracted blade is tipped with the image of a god – apparently the trickster Gloom, beloved by raiders. The hilt has been fortified with a metal sleeve and strips of coarse leather.</string>
<string id="4268">The name of this glaive means "The Way of Pain" in the Slavard tongue. The blade's unusual shape has been augmented with dragon's teeth and a long, sharpened hook that is equally good for parrying enemy blows and disemboweling foes.</string>
<string id="4269">Blackened metal, flawlessly forged and with hooks in complex shapes. This Gottlung glaive once belonged to one of the warrior priests of the Vaktaarkangen brotherhood, who are famed for their inhuman cruelty and skill in battle.</string>
<string id="4270">The blade is adorned with an image of the sun-faced goddess holding a sacrificial sickle of the kind best used to pull horsemen from their steeds or sever tendons. The pole is wrapped in tooled leather.</string>
<string id="4271">This weapon resembles a tongue of flame frozen into a hunk of tempered steel. Bronze and gilt play upon the wide, sharp blade on a pole wrapped in morocco straps.</string>
<string id="4272">A long, triangular blade with a pristinely smooth, razor-sharp edge. Glaive is adorned with the Eye, crafted out of slivers of gilt steel. Yew wood and thin strips of leather lead to an austere yet elegant pommel finish</string>
<string id="4273">A rather fanciful hat made of blue silk with a rough canvas band fitted tightly around the head. Hats like these are typically worn by small-time merchants, town criers, and scribes.</string>
<string id="4274">A jaunty hat with a bent brim made of thick, aged leather.</string>
<string id="4275">Hats with bent brims like this one are frequently worn by traveling merchants. Its soft leather lining is solid enough to protect against wind and rain.</string>
<string id="4276">Simple, rough headwear – a white canvas hood sewn onto a wide-brimmed straw hat as a kind of lining.</string>
<string id="4277">A hat with ear flaps made of coarse linen and fringed with wool. It's not much to look at, but it's warm.</string>
<string id="4278">A skullcap with fur on the inside. A short tail hangs down from the back to carefully cover the nape of the wearer's neck.</string>
<string id="4279">A tall fur-lined hat with a leather hood rakishly cocked to one side. </string>
<string id="4280">A skullcap made of horse hide stitched roughly and irregularly. Its warm, sturdy felt lining is turned slightly inside-out to resemble a fur border.</string>
<string id="4281">A hat made of crimson goat leather with some kind of dark fur with red spots – probably dog – sewn around it.</string>
<string id="4282">A tall hat made of ox hide. It has been poorly dyed with brown and red stripes.</string>
<string id="4283">Unimpressive-looking pointed shoes with boiled leather soles. The thin rope laces literally fall apart in your hands, leaving red fibers on your fingers.</string>
<string id="4284">These boots are made of cow leather. They are sturdy, shapeless, and have enormous bootlegs that slap against the calves with each step.</string>
<string id="4285">Boots with bent tips that fit the foot snugly. Indispensable footwear among Khoors horsemen.</string>
<string id="4286">Boots like these are made of pieces of thick felt. They are surprisingly warm and almost waterproof and can last for years.</string>
<string id="4287">Shoes with no tips made of coarse linen and leather scraps.</string>
<string id="4288">Short shoes with thin straps. Simple, but with a pretense to elegance.</string>
<string id="4289">Rough peasant shoes with wooden heels that make a loud clacking sound when you walk.</string>
<string id="4290">Rustic gauntlets made of two layers of solid linen. They might protect you against work-related callouses, but they won't do much against the cold.</string>
<string id="4291">A bascinet made from excellent Gottlung steel. The visor with narrow eye-slits has been polished to a fine sheen. The helmet itself is framed in a barely-visible leaf ornament and decorated with stripes of black and white lacquer.</string>
<string id="4292">A luxurious forged cuirass with a gorget and shoulders made from small polished plates. The breastplate is adorned with black and white stripes, and words of prayer shine upon it with the dull glimmer of gilt.</string>
<string id="4293">A plate bracer adorned with black and white stripes. It covers the elbow and forearm well but is still light and mobile. It is decorated with monograms drawn in black lacquer and lined with soft leather on the inside.</string>
<string id="4294">These warm, comfortable gauntlets are made from soft leather treated in a special manner. The inside of the gauntlets is lined with overlapping plates of tempered steel that can even withstand a blow from a poleaxe.</string>
<string id="4295">Chainmail pants made of tiny rings of blackened steel and ending in steel greaves. The polished metal is decorated with an engraving, and the plates on the greaves are joined with gilded rivets.</string>
<string id="4296">Knight's boots made of steel plates. Despite their weight, they are rather comfortable and do not hamper the wearer's movements.</string>
<string id="4297">Beneath the lining of this luxurious conical helmet hides a sturdy aventail framed with blackened steel plates. The warrior's face is protected by a mask of pure silver.</string>
<string id="4298">This long-hemmed tunic is covered with hundreds of steel scales, and the pauldrons, sleeves, and hems are elegantly adorned with golden trim.</string>
<string id="4299">A wave of triangular scales streams down the shoulders of these bracers, ending in sleeves made of several thick plates linked by elegant gilded buckles.</string>
<string id="4300">These gauntlets are somehow ungainly, being made entirely from tiny plates of polished steel. On the inside is a silk lining tied to the edges of the gauntlets by thick golden trim.</string>
<string id="4301">Soft pants made of ox leather covered with square steel plates as smooth as mirrors.</string>
<string id="4302">These boots are comprised of forged steel shoe and soft leather tops covered with rows of overlapping steel plates. Straps that help to fit the boot snugly to the foot are hidden under some of the plates.</string>
<string id="4303">A menacing horned helmet. A gilded half-mask and a long, thick aventail reaching all the way down to the warrior's chest are attached to the forged headpiece.</string>
<string id="4304">This long chainmail tunic is striking thanks to its abundance of detail. It is thickly woven and has a forged breastplate to which a fur cloak with a chainmail backing is attached with straps.</string>
<string id="4305">Chainmail bracers with leather lining and large plates covering the most vulnerable areas.</string>
<string id="4306">Gauntlets made of the smallest rings. They are durable enough to protect the arm and thin enough not to interfere with the warrior's grip. The back of the hand is decorated with silver-plated plates.</string>
<string id="4307">Pants made of strips of ring mail. They stand apart from most similar armor thanks to the unparalleled quality of the weaving and their forged greaves with patterns tooled along the edges.</string>
<string id="4308">Boots made of strips of ring mail with steel tops. Made of calfskin, they are sturdy on the outside and soft and comfortable on the inside.</string>
<string id="4309">A pointed helmet reminiscent of a Khoors tent. The top part is forged, and the helmet itself is made of several layers of thick studded leather and outfitted with a steel nose-guard.</string>
<string id="4310">A tastefully made and decorated calfskin overcoat with a broad crimson belt and a felt doublet that can absorb hacking blows. It is reinforced with studded-leather and steel plates.</string>
<string id="4311">A pair of leather bracers made of pieces of boiled leather riveted together. They are stitched for greater sturdiness. The elbows are protected with steel plates.</string>
<string id="4312">Leather gauntlets with soft cuffs. They are lined with black silk sewn with silvery thread. They fit the hand... well, like a glove.</string>
<string id="4313">These leather greaves are made of layers of lacquered leather riveted together in an overlapping pattern. The abundance of rivets, tooled decorations, and patterned trim make them uniquely elegant and beautiful items.</string>
<string id="4314">Short dark-red morocco boots. They appear deceptively light, but penetrating them isn't easy – their tops are reinforced with two layers of studded leather that reliably protect the warrior's legs.</string>
<string id="4315">A skullcap made of tempered steel with a quilted aventail. Double-stitched sturdy silk thread combines two layers of soft leather lined with horsehair and a fine chainmail netting that cannot be seen from the side.</string>
<string id="4316">A light quilted jacket that fits the torso perfectly and is carefully conceived – behind the rabbit-fur lining is a layer of sticky boiled leather, and the most vulnerable areas are protected by thin steel plates.</string>
<string id="4317">Magnificently crafted quilted bracers adorned with stripes of blue-black leather.</string>
<string id="4318">Gauntlets made from several layers of coarse linen lined with pieces of tanned leather. Sturdy enough to stop a spear or soften a blow from a club.</string>
<string id="4319">Quilted greaves. Strips of yarn, horsehair, and some chainmail netting can be felt through the dark-blue fabric. The greaves nevertheless provide excellent protection.</string>
<string id="4320">Boots made from thin leather covered with rhombuses of quilted linen. They would be weightless if not for the steel plates sewn inside of them to protect the calf and instep.</string>
<string id="4321">This clothing might be simple, but it is also skillfully made. You won't find any tiny scraps or a sackcloth lining here. The sleeves and hems are adorned with subtle ribbons and embroidery. The seams may be coarse, but they are also sturdy, and the fabric is decent. A shirt like this will keep your back from getting too sweaty while plowing the fields.</string>
<string id="4322">Peasant attire – simple, but elegant. The sleeves and hems are sewn with ribbons and patterned trim. The clothing itself is dyed bright colors and almost seems to glow.</string>
<string id="4323">This novice's robe with a soft white tunic looks solemn and strict. The coal-black cloak worn over it is trimmed with symbols sewn with crimson and white silk.</string>
<string id="4324">A black shirt with a leather apron covering the smith's body and legs. One's gaze becomes lost in the crimson patterns and symbols, the secret nature of which is known only to Accurs and the smiths themselves. The interwoven symbols frame a ruby Eye of the Sleeper with a sheen of metal dust. The apron is belted with a thin woven belt on which tongs and small hammers are hung in strict order to make sure that every tool is available and in the right place.</string>
<string id="4325">A foppish getup worn by city-dwelling carpenters and joiners. Apparently this kind of clothing is, to a large extent, a sign of mastery and a symbol of belonging to the profession, but it is also especially good for work — convenient pockets sewn onto the apron and jacket, sturdy, dirt-resistant pants made of boiled leather, and loops on the straps for tools.</string>
<string id="4326">A decorated potion-brewer's cloak made of magenta linen. It is light and spacious, but fits very well, with sleeves with strings for greater comfort. This outfit has a special feature: a belt not unlike a sword belt on which hang countless chubby flasks of smoky glass.</string>
<string id="4327">A crimson shirt adorned with dull golden patterns. From the outfit's countless tassels hang bronze tools whose names are known only to the engineers themselves... if they are known to anyone at all. Measurements and angles, which are absolutely necessary for various drafting and engineering projects, are sewn into the leather jacket, which is belted with a broad belt.</string>
<string id="4328">A cook's outfit — a blue cotton vest, a shirt of light-colored linen, and, most importantly, a broad apron made of white fabric with pockets for salt and spices, as well as countless straps. A handy thing for attaching knives, spoon, ladles, and other crucial cooking utensils to.</string>

<string id="4420">The Gravedigger said to look for baromsag in clay. There should be clay deposits to the south of the village.</string>
<string id="4421">Tell the Gravedigger that you didn't find baromsag...</string>
<string id="4422">You should look for mushrooms on the forest floor at the base of trees.</string>

<string id="4427">You need weapons to hunt. You can make a slingshot out of a branch and plant fibers; everything you need for a slingshot that hurls stones can be collected from the ground.&#xA;&#xA;An ax used for cutting down trees is also a decent weapon.</string>
<string id="4428">Choose an animal you're up to the task of subduing. You won't get far using your fists against a bear, for example: a sow or deer would be a better choice. You need a knife to carve up the animal; you can make one from a branch and flint stone.</string>

<string id="4522">This is a seafarer's weapon. You can almost see raging waves in the cold gleam of the steel. This long sword ends in a sharp fang that makes its blade resemble a boarding grapnel.</string>
<string id="4523">A triangular eye surrounded by crude dispersing patterns is frozen on this sword's long blade. Its massive guard wrapped in straps of two-colored leather is covered by a steel bar that runs along its entire length.</string>
<string id="4524">The silhouette of a fish can barely be discerned in this heavy, capriciously curved blade. Despite its complex shape, it could hardly be considered elegant. Instead it is intentionally crude in the Slavard manner. Runes promising an agonizing death to all enemies have been carved into the sword.</string>
<string id="4525">A curved broadsword abundantly decorated with gilded tongues of flame. Khoors metalwork. The pommel is adorned with pike blades – yet another pattern typical of the steppe-dwellers.</string>
<string id="4526">A massive ceremonial two-handed Gottlung sword that gleams with a golden hue. The guard and pommel are also gilded. Combined with the black leather in which the handle is wrapped, this sword looks especially luxurious.</string>
<string id="4527">The handiwork of a Gottlung weaponsmith can be recognized at first glance – the knuckle bow shaped like a dragon's tail and the intense silhouette of the straight sword are dead giveaways. The words of a warrior's moto have been gilded and worked into the white matte steel.</string>

<string id="4559">Svefni's Vengeance</string>
<string id="4560">It's not the hammer-work, or the metal, or the intricate runes on the blade, but rather the hand of a master craftsman that holds true value. Ulfbrecht Firehand passed on many years ago, but simple swords with hilts and pommels reminiscent of the work of the revered master are still forged to this day.</string>
<string id="4561">The striped drawing on this blade is a tribute to an age-old tradition. Blades cooled in a block of river ice after being forged were marked like this in olden times, as they are to this day.</string>
<string id="4562">A Slavard sword adorned with engraved waves. It may be a simple weapon, but it's also crafted with care and bit of cleverness: the balance is displaced to the tip of the blade, and the hilt is wrapped in waterproof oiled leather. These blades are very popular among northern sailors.</string>
<string id="4563">The sword's hilt and pommel are topped with falcon's heads. It is a symbol, a memory that has been lost and forgotten. According to this legend, the falcon is considered to be the bird of the konungs, but not even the wise Accurs know or remember why.</string>
<string id="4564">This weapon is the fruit of the labor of a truly talented master craftsman. The blade's engraved fuller is lacquered and dappled with runes. The gilded symbols burn as though crying out the names of the gods.</string>
<string id="4565">The massive runes carved into the steel of this blade spell out a curse promising death and defeat with true northern directness. The guard and pommel are barbed and decorated with a simplistic, yet tasteful pattern.</string>
<string id="4566">A broad, sumptuously adorned blade made from top-notch steel. The words of the legend of the Ice Knezes are carved into the golden whorls along the fuller. How many swords like this are there in the world? You could count them on the fingers of one hand. And one of them is yours.</string>
<string id="4567">He will awaken in wrath and set forth for a new battle. These words shine with a golden glimmer on the burnished steel. The sword's pommel is adorned with a bloody Eye.</string>

<string id="4593">This heraldic banner is worn only by the best warriors who do not cover their shiny armor with tabards.</string>
<string id="4594">This scarlet banner with a brocade border is the essential symbol of the light cavalry that was in use in the time of the Vulpiс Empire.</string>
<string id="4595">Every truly battle-hardened warrior knows this symbol: the head of a unicorn on red canvas has long been the mark of heavy cavalry.</string>
<string id="4596">Pikemen love to show off their spears on their banners, however they are drawn. Be they artless silhouettes like arrowheads or elegant sharp-pointed complex shapes, the leaf-green background is constant.</string>
<string id="4597">A halberd is a serious weapon in principle, and its banner was designed to match: a sturdy bolt of emerald silk emblazoned with the image of the halberd embroidered in silver-white thread.</string>
<string id="4598">These light blue infantry banners are always found on the front lines. Under this standard march shieldbearers, protecting their brothers-in-arms the pikemen and archers from enemy arrows.</string>
<string id="4599">This piece of thick blue velvet is decorated with a simple, recognizable symbol: a full-height infantry shield.</string>
<string id="4600">Paint from the northern shores gives this banner a pale but fast gold hue. Once, these flags with a white axe terrified the inhabitants of the coastal villages, suddenly appearing through a thick fog accompanied by the cries of warriors and the noise of arriving ships.</string>
<string id="4601">The shape of a two-handed sword is stitched into this pale yellow cloth. Such banners fly high over the fray of battle, sowing fear into the hearts of those who stand against them.</string>
<string id="4602">The bow in this embroidered complex design is barely visible on the violet banner. Some say that this symbol, like the bow itself, was invented by Aori Goldenhanded.</string>
<string id="4603">This massive purple silk banner is marked with a white symbol that can be seen from afar. This mark looks like all the Slavard runes thrown together, represents the crossbow, as well as all warriors that use them.</string>
<string id="4604">This banner is dyed brown. It is not the most eye-catching color, but the trebuchet men do not need a bright flag. Their massive machines can be seen on the battlefield without such standards.</string>

<string id="4613">Dead Ice Spade</string>
<string id="4614">Harvesting Shovel of Kalle</string>
<string id="4615">The handle of this shovel is covered in extremely durable steel with a light, barely noticeable bluing. Like many Gottlung tools, this shovel is topped by a massive knob depicting the Eye, but the leaf-like ornament on the blade is somewhat bewildering. This is probably not symbol of Kallente, but rather a sprout of the Tree — small and slender, but gaining strength.</string>
<string id="4616">The rakishly curved tongues of flame are no decoration, but rather a tribute to the Khoors legend of the living flame. They say a flame once burst forth from the forge beneath the roots of the Tree. It passed through the steppe, and from its ashes were born rye, barley, and edible roots. This shovel is lucky. The nomads believe that it somehow attracts the Sparks, the few particles of living flame that still smolder in the rich black soil of the steppe.</string>
<string id="4617">Soft straps of tanned hide cover this thin, lacquered handle. It is topped by a strange, yet familiar symbol: Jhode's diadem and Jomfru's signs resembling sharpened knives. The iron is of high quality and clearly of Gottlung origin, but the white stripes of salt carved into the scratched steel recall the distant northern shores where this tool was forged.</string>
<string id="4618">Chunks of ruddy steppe soil can still be found on the broad, rounded shoulders of this shovel. The blade is riveted in thick plates of tempered iron. Half of the rivets are steel, and the other half are large, bronze, and clearly forged by another hand. This shovel must have traveled far and wide and seen many lands.</string>

<string id="4638">It's more of a symbol than a tool. On the metal sheets framing the head are intricate figures: humans shaped into runes. From father to son, from son to grandson, from grandson to great grandson. As long as this lineage lasts, and the spark of their descendants lives on, this magical shovel will serve them eternally.</string>
<string id="4639">This tool was made very carefully, but also with charmingly naive simplicity. The primitive eye and comfortable handle mark the work of a village craftsman. But of what quality! Observe the polished shoulders, easy-to-use point, and the scarlet ribbon with prayers written in an ancient dialect of Northern Götland.</string>
<string id="4640">A golden rod imbued with leaden heaviness. It is an allegory for power, no doubt, more than a tool. A luxurious, dangerous, heavy burden, useless in itself, but meaningful as a symbol. On the gilded ribbon, carved in ornate letters are the words: "Rule or die." Though some more pessimistic souls suggest that there is no "or" there: "Rule and die."</string>

<string id="4715">Ceremonial Crossbow</string>
<string id="4716">Crossbow of the Hunt</string>
<string id="4717">Sunmaiden Maksha Crossbow</string>
<string id="4718">Most of these crossbows are nearly 100 years old. After lying idle in the army's arsenal, these crossbows arrived on boats with the survivors and have become one of the most recognizable symbols of the settlers. The handle of painted maple is decorated with the Eye of the Sleeping God and the symbol of the royal archers. Some craftsmen brand their crossbows with their symbol, but on yours, the craftsman's symbol cannot be made out.</string>
<string id="4719">Not all foreign weapons have a special name in Khoorsian. The steppe-dwellers respectfully call these crossbows "Amghooy tatsa" or "swift death". They may look simple, but they are reliable weapons, plus you can use the metal tail to crack nuts. Or enemies' heads.</string>
<string id="4720">The world telmir itself went out of use several centuries ago, but it perfectly applies to this crossbow. The metal design on the handle depicts the legendary serpent Tolki, who was fated to battle Svefnii. These crude, antique crossbows are believed to be enchanted, and that belief is strong even beyond the far northern lands.</string>
<string id="4721">The small, long signature carved into the handle declares the origins of this crossbow: "Made in the workshop of Hedrick vallum Wirmouth for the royal court." This exquisite weapon is one-of-a-kind: even the layers of ivory that grace its surface have an intricate unrepeating pattern forming an ornate vine, and the metal appears to represent the World Snake, the traditional decoration of the weapons of the Gottlungs.</string>
<string id="4722">They say that these crossbows were made by none other than Orgend, one of the last artisan giants who lived in the old world. It is believed that he could speak Common, as well as read and write, and all his weapons were decorated with the shapes of animals. Of course, that could be something a merchant made up to raise the price. Who would know?</string>
<string id="4723">An unknown master created this crossbow out of the wood of an ash tree. And image of Jhode would be fitting on the handle of that thing which brings death, but the creator thought otherwise, and as if to laugh in the face of fear, decorated the weapon with flowers and a golden vine.</string>

<string id="4796">Serpent's Malchus</string>
<string id="4797">Harvester</string>
<string id="4798">In the channels carved along the handle of this axe are golden patterns in which everyone sees what they want to see. One might see Holza's thread, another might glimpse the Eye, and, if they want to badly enough, another just might see Northern runes.</string>
<string id="4799">A treasured weapon among rich mercenaries who usually buy it not for battle, but for bragging rights. All of these axes are believed to be copies of the beloved weapon of Roderic the Gray, the famous woodland bandit.</string>
<string id="4800">The groove on the blade takes on a certain significance if you hold the weapon handle-down: you can see a depiction of a dungeon beneath the roots of the Tree and a massive Spark at its center – the allegory of the greatest of weapons. The Slavards are always glad to point out that the symbol is carved not into a sword, but an axe, just as it is told in the Northern legends.</string>
<string id="4801">The tale of the wild Gavran has come down to us from olden times: there was once a gang of seamen who sowed terror among merchant ships and port cities. For twenty years they pillaged without getting caught. They say that their weapons – even their axes – were ornately decorated, and they still pop up in weapon shops from time to time.</string>
<string id="4802">The most valuable part of this sword is not the black blade made of hard Gottlung steel or the tongues of golden flame, but the silver-coated guard depicting a wrathful smith-god with a smoldering visage. This adornment is much more ancient than the sword itself. The inscription on the brand says "He who from the verge of oblivion hails."</string>
<string id="4803">The gilded engraving contains Slavard motifs and brief inscriptions in the Gottlung tongue. This coarse, yet beautiful sword is clearly the work of a Northern master craftsman. The serpent on the pommel is Tolki, and the ruby in his jaws represents the Spark of the Hammerer.</string>
<string id="4804">An ancient and rare item of dwindling supply. It is a ritual weapon of a vanished cult of assassins who once worshiped Johde. It could be a fake, but its authenticity is quite simple to verify: if the falchion is real, then any blood that empurples the blade will flow along the runnels and into the goddess's sickle, turning it crimson.</string>

<string id="4875">Mountain Hammer</string>
<string id="4876">Cast Ax</string>
<string id="4877">Craftsman's Pickax</string>
<string id="4878">First-rate tempered steel is hardly this tool's crowning glory. Anyone who picks it up is sure to notice the strange color of the bright-purple straps. Some say that the people of the north extract the dye from terrible white sea creatures that get caught in their nets.</string>
<string id="4879">The Khoors have few truly useful tools, but this is one of them. The head of this pickax is not simply forged, it's cut from a thick tempered rod, decorated with intricate carvings and gilding. The thick handle of the tool it woven from top to bottom in soft leather straps.</string>
<string id="4880">Once there was an imperial province with a workshop where people from across the land traveled to get their tools. These pickaxes have maintained their value: The shining, untarnished gilding, the comfortable handles, and plush leather. Also, each pickax is decorated with a carved figure of a god.</string>
<string id="4881">For a northerner, a pickax like this is much more than a mere tool. It is a holy relic passed from father to son. Its wooden handle is covered in patterns and runes, and the older the pickax, and the longer the family's history, the more runes and symbols adorn it.</string>
<string id="4882">The secret of this alloy is now hidden in distant mountains across the ocean. The pale metal does not rust. It cools and heats gradually, and it is light enough to make an entire tool out of it, handle and all.</string>
<string id="4883">This tool may seem hastily made, but it was constructed with great knowledge. Instead of gilding, it has copper plating, and instead of decorations, it is topped by a small steel pick. The handle is encompassed by simple straps of boiled leather.</string>
<string id="4884">Excommunicated</string>

<string id="4886">The sunlight playing on the simple pattern of gold thread gives life to the sparks, and the details shimmer when the wind blows.

<string id="4887">Archimancurus' Old Garb</string>
<string id="4888">Time has not been kind to this scarlet mantle, but a gentle, noble shimmer remains unaltered. It bears a barely noticeable pattern, decorated with leaves, roots, and sparks in its iridescent sheen. The fabric is of Khoorsian origin, but it is not often to be found even in the largest markets of Kaskir-Unon. It was obviously custom made.</string>
<string id="4889">Ancient Makthrid Costume</string>
<string id="4890">This old mantle seems almost velveteen to the touch: many years have passed, but the fabric, shipped from the southern coast, has not been worn through. The garment is tailored to the owner's exact figure and is sewn in thousands of large, reliable stitches made by the diligent hands of apprentices.</string>

<string id="4926">Sickle of Abundant Reaping</string>
<string id="4927">No, that isn't gold: It's a simple pattern that seems to shine, never dimming or wearing away as time goes by. Those inclined to believe in superstitions swear the blade of this sickle rings quietly when ripe wheat is near. The handle smells faintly of grass. Whether it soaked in the aroma in the fields or the scent is the remained of a magic potion inside, no one can say.</string>
<string id="4928">Sun Sickle</string>
<string id="4929">An ancient, special thing. This sickle is the work of a less than gifted smith, but it is not crude. Steel with an admixture of copper came out light, flexible, and strong. The gold spots on the blade create a strange pattern that can be contemplated for hours. It is said that sometimes face of Amate can be seen in these spots. Who knows?</string>
<string id="4930">Bandit's Bardiche</string>
<string id="4931">The Slavard runes etched in the blade form a simple prayers—asking the gods to accept this bloody sacrifice. In exchange, the bearer of the weapon asks for a small boon: protection from the noose, the gallows, and any other shameful death. The handle of the bardiche ends with something remotely similar to a pike pole. It seems that once this weapon served a marauder plundering the coast.</string>
<string id="4932">Intricate Halberd</string>
<string id="4933">The hard steel of the blade is difficult to sharpen, but once sharpened, it stays that way for a long time. The head itself was forged in the days of the royal court; it acquired its proud, gilded ornaments much later, just like its sanded oaken handle, protected with flaxseed oil. How many craftsmen labored over this incredible weapon?</string>
<string id="4934">Igelsbronn</string>
<string id="4935">These spears have a dubious honor. They say they smell distinctly of blood, even years after their last use in battle. Legend has it that sometimes in the dark of the night, needles on these spears come to life with sparks, the souls of the fallen warriors searching endlessly for His forge.</string>
<string id="4936">Twintail</string>
<string id="4937">It is tempting to think that this clever spear was born of some kind of joke, but the gray-haired half-blind elders recall Ordun the Marten and his band who was famous for their endless resourcefulness and creativity. Triangular helms with two layers of aventail, shields covered by ductile leather and these very spears have outlived their original bearers and even the memory of them.</string>
<string id="4938">Imperial Lance</string>
<string id="4939">Is that steel? Or silver? Not every smith can tell, and only a rare few can recall this celestial metal which is occasionally discovered in remote lands. The spear itself impresses with its simplicity and at the same time, the minute details of its construction. If you look carefully, you're bound to find a subtle signature in the shape of a crown. What does it mean? Opinions vary.</string>
<string id="4940">Cavalry Master's Spear</string>
<string id="4941">Finding a weapon like this one is a great stroke of luck. Very few were ever made. One for each of the cavalry commanders who served in the army of the Vulpian Empire. It seems as though time has not touched this weapon. The blued steel flashes with a dry shine and the gilding looks fresh. Though the Empire and the cavalry masters are no more, the spears remain. And will remain for ages to come.</string>
<string id="4942">Aorienknecht</string>
<string id="4943">The sheen of gold that covered this lance can drive a man to distraction, but the spear is not for parades. It's heavy, hard blade was indeed intended for battle and honed to the sharpness of a razor. The craftsman's stamp is nowhere to be seen, but nevertheless, it's clear this is one of a kind.</string>
<string id="4944">Goldflower</string>
<string id="4945">A fine halberd with a dubious honor. No one makes such arms anymore, so know, if you come across this in a store, it is either a very good fake or looted from a grave, torn from the bony grip of a dead guard who served the highest echelons of the fallen Empire.</string>
<string id="4946">Runic Halberd</string>
<string id="4947">The blade is adorned with a runic poem and is much older than the other parts of the weapon. This halberd was cobbled together from many parts, from the traditions and materials of the lands of the Empire. Here there is red gold from the Khoorish steppe and there mottled northern steel, and it is covered in rhombuses and rivers that mark it unequivocally as a Gottlung weapon.</string>
<string id="4948">Gavran of the Dead</string>
<string id="4949">This weapon is from a time and place where marauding was no shame. The bardiche looks like a war axe without a brand, but everyone knows that it was forged by Hodrick the Feeble, one of the greatest smiths of the North. It was one of the last he forged. Among the dead soldiers depicted on the side of the Gavran, a young face can be seen. It is Hodrick's son who died in battle.</string>

<string id="4960">Landsknechtsschwert</string>
<string id="4961">The silhouette of this sword is ideal for crests: There isn't a stronger or more recognizable weapon in all the world. This shape has been repeated by many craftsmen, but this blade was made with special love and care. The symbol on crossguard though now partially worn away still reads "Manfred" to those who look closely.</string>
<string id="4962">Tolkischwert</string>
<string id="4963">The overstated grace of this claymore is deceptive: It's not just a toy for jesters at the fair to chop up pumpkins while blindfolded to the roar of the crowd. The weapon is large, but perfectly balanced. This sword comes from the distant shores of the old world. The leather braiding on the hilt has not lost its color over the years: a sign that the weapon has been taken care of.</string>
<string id="4964">Schwarzenblod</string>
<string id="4965">An unremarkable claymore which will attract the gaze of any connoisseur. The pattern is etched into it in a special way. A weapon like that could only have been forged in one place: in the remote, swampy regions of the southeast of the fallen empire. The steel blade sharpens poorly, but it is almost eternal and retains its sharpness once earned.</string>
<string id="4966">Lord of the North</string>
<string id="4967">The runes on the blade of this sword have been reforged many times. The explanation for this lies in the Slavard traditions: A claymore like this is nothing more than a gift from a jarl to his eldest son. If the elder perished, the sword was passed on to the next. And the dedication, emblazoned on the blade, had to be changed accordingly.</string>
<string id="4968">Great Claymore</string>
<string id="4969">This sword bears silent witness to a great plague, and is a mournful reminder of the world we left behind across the great water... Once, such swords were used by the imperial cavalry when they had to battle on foot.</string>
<string id="4970">Gold-headed Lance</string>
<string id="4971">A weapon whose rich luxury obscures what is most important. The head of the spear is carved of elm. Long-lived and light, it was soaked in a special solution which gives it the fastness of stone.</string>
<string id="4972">Dark Hand</string>
<string id="4973">An experienced warrior will see right through the deceptive simplicity of this spear. The vamplate that protects the bearer's hand was forged with great care and delicacy. The whole weapon, from tip to end is composed of many small layers of burnished steel. And each layer bears the mark of the forges of the capital...</string>
<string id="4974">Guardian</string>
<string id="4975">The artisan who created this spear no doubt competed in tournaments himself: the attention to detail would be unusual for a craftsman unfamiliar with the sport. Even the gilded engraving is slightly recessed into the polished steel, to prevent it from fading, no doubt.</string>
<string id="4976">Blintzenspier</string>
<string id="4977">A copy of the legendary jousting lance that once belonged to Roderic Affelheim, a knight who was very close to the Sovereign. Weapons like this are the result of many master craftsmen's toil, trying whatever materials they could in a desperate attempt to achieve the perfect strength and balance the original lance had. Whether or not any can be considered a success is unknown.</string>
<string id="4978">Sentry</string>
<string id="4979">Every weapon shop of the old empire was overstuffed with bows like these, but only a rare few were made as well as this one. This bow, braided with two different kinds of leather, has enough power to pierce an enemy wearing light armor.</string>
<string id="4980">Falconer</string>
<string id="4981">Even in the best of times, only two hundred of these bows could be made. Their delicate, stamped silver detailing point to their Khoorish origins, but the style of the bow is typical of Gottlung design: requiring strength to draw, but shooting long distances.</string>
<string id="4982">Aoru Utzgoul</string>
<string id="4983">What makes this weapon remarkable is not its fine finishing. These mighty bows are not made, but grown. Their tale begins with a pale white willow branch at a bend of the river, chanted over by a shaman of the steppe. In its fourth year, it is cut and bathed in the smoke of desert grass, and enveloped in gold.</string>
<string id="4984">Widowed Bow</string>
<string id="4985">This northern bow may seem crude and overlarge. What's more, rumors say that all these bows are cursed, and their owners, knowingly or not, serve the Ice-Eyed Johde. The bowstring is woven from the hair of a widow. Supposedly, the hair is the source of the bow's magical power.</string>
<string id="4986">Baron's Bow</string>
<string id="4987">The limbs of this bow rival yew in springiness, but the wood itself is light and dense, with a nearly imperceptible pink tint. Its origins are hard to pin down. The ornate embellishments of this weapon are not gilded steel, but pure gold.</string>

<string id="5055">The blade of this sword is forged straight and later sharpened in the Flamberge manner. Such difficult work is justified, as this blade outmatches even tempered blades in strength. Its form is simple and minimal: in it, one can sense the hand of a master craftsman.</string>
<string id="5056">Svargralf</string>
<string id="5057">This sword's name is an ancient Slavard word that indicates the claw of either a bear or a wolf. The blade is fully worthy of this name: crude, simple, savage, and a little rusted, but surprisingly deadly.</string>
<string id="5058">Ulcer</string>
<string id="5059">The dark cherry lacquer on the blade may be reminiscent of a flame, but rumor has given this sword a different name. The caustic nickname Ulcer, given by mercenaries, comes from its ability to leave gaping wounds that do not heal.</string>
<string id="5060">Count's Flamberge</string>
<string id="5061">The gilt on this sword is applied in a special way: it doesn't tarnish with time, there are almost no scratches on it, and the inscription on the hilt glimmers like a diamond. The blacksmith's brand, stamped in an inconspicuous place, is death's head with its eyes rolled back. Whose brand is it? No one knows.</string>

<string id="5079">Formal Cavalry Glaive</string>
<string id="5080">A long green tunic covered by a well-made knee-length cloak. Beneath the thick flax is a quilted lining of soft leather. Thick golden trim twists around it, adorning the cloak's tails and sleeves.</string>
<string id="5081">This glaive's rough handle has been dried almost to the point of turning white. A carelessly-made blade covered in rough, straight teeth has been attached to the thickened part.</string>
<string id="5082">The intricately forged tip is hollow, and a steel ring slips back and forth across it, making the blade heavier when it strikes. "Turneskangen" is carved into the glaive, signifying that this is the weapon of a warrior-priest sworn to protect the tower of the same name.</string>
<string id="5083">Polished to a sheen, the steel blade is adorned with a flat, gilded bas-relief depicting Terskel holding a horn. The handle is no less sumptuous - it is covered in strips of black leather and trimmed in gold.</string>
<string id="5084">It is unusual to find a glaive with a two-sided blade. However, the abundance of tiny, fine details clearly indicates this weapon's intended purpose: it is part of the formal gear of the elite black cavalry.</string>
